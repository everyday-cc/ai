title: "Machine Learning Strategy That Leverages Large Data sets to Boost Statistical Power in Small-Scale Experiments"
excerpt: "Find more information on the Altmetric Attention Score and how the score is calculated. Machine learning methods have proven invaluable for increasing the sensitivity of peptide detection in proteomics experiments. Most modern tools, such as Percolator and PeptideProphet, use semisupervised algorithms to learn models directly from the data sets ..."
