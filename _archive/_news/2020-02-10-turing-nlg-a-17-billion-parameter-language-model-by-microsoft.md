title: "Turing-NLG: A 17-billion-parameter language model by Microsoft"
excerpt: "have improved the state of the art on nearly every downstream natural language processing (NLP) task, including question answering, conversational agents, and document understanding among others. We are releasing a private demo of T-NLG, including its freeform generation, question answering, and summarization capabilities, to a small set of ..."

    excerpt: "Microsoft Research today announced DeepSpeed, a new deep learning optimization library that can train massive 100-billion-parameter models. In AI, you need to have larger natural language models for better accuracy. But training larger natural language models is time consuming and the costs associated with it are very high. Microsoft claims ..."
