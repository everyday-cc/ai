title: "A reassuring nod to the mayor and the potential benefits of a robot vacuum"
excerpt: "OPINION: Warning. Warning. This may not be one of my columns. It could have been produced by something called \"AI\", which stands for artificial intelligence, or given another name â€“ a robot. I've just read about a university lecturer who produced a credible essay by feeding a bunch of genuine ones into a computer with an AI programme."
