title: "Artificial neural networks may benefit from ‘sleep’ breaks"
excerpt: "Scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory have found that artificial neural networks (ANNs) which closely mimic biology may benefit from sleep-like cycles. These cycles appear to quell the instability associated with uninterrupted unsupervised learning."
