title: "Meet Your New Corporate Office Mate: A ‘Brainless’ Robot"
excerpt: "The new workers zipped around the office completing mundane tasks like fetching coffee, delivering meals and handing off packages. They did not get in anyone’s way or violate personal space. They waited unobtrusively for elevators with unfailing politeness. And, perhaps most enticingly, they did not complain. That’s because they were robots."
