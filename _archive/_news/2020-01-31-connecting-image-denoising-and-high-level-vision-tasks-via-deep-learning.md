title: "Connecting Image Denoising and High-Level Vision Tasks via Deep Learning"
excerpt: "Abstract: Image denoising and high-level vision tasks are usually handled independently in the conventional practice of computer vision, and their connection is fragile. In this paper, we cope with the two jointly and explore the mutual influence between them with the focus on two questions, namely (1) how image denoising can help improving ..."

  - title: "Semantic Segmentation With Context Encoding and Multi-Path Decoding"
    excerpt: "Abstract: Semantic image segmentation aims to classify every pixel of a scene image to one of many classes. It implicitly involves object recognition, localization, and boundary delineation. In this paper, we propose a segmentation network called CGBNet to enhance the segmentation performance by context encoding and multi-path decoding."
