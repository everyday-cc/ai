title: "Create Amazon SageMaker models using the PyTorch Model Zoo"
excerpt: "Deploying high-quality, trained machine learning (ML) models to perform either batch or real-time inference is a critical piece of bringing value to customers. However, the ML experimentation process can be tedious—there are a lot of approaches requiring a significant amount of time to implement. That’s"
