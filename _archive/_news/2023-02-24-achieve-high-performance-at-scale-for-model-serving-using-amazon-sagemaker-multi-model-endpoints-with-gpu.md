title: "Achieve high performance at scale for model serving using Amazon SageMaker multi-model endpoints with GPU"
excerpt: "Amazon SageMaker multi-model endpoints (MMEs) provide a scalable and cost-effective way to deploy a large number of machine learning (ML) models. It gives you the ability to deploy multiple ML models in a single serving container behind a single endpoint. From there, SageMaker manages loading and unloading"
