title: "Need for Hidden Layers and Activation function in Neural Network"
excerpt: "The artificial neural network is a computing system inspired by the principle of biological neural network in the human brain. It is a set of machine learning algorithms that are structured like the brainâ€™s neural network. This network is based on some interconnected units named neurons. The connection between neurons can transmit a signal ..."
