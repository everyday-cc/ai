    excerpt: "Not too long ago, tech enthusiasts were telling us that by 2020, we would see self-driving cars hit the mainstream, with some 10 million on the roads. That turned out to be a wild overestimation. The actual number of vehicles in testing is thousands of times smaller, and these are still being driven mostly in controlled conditions. Companies ..."

    excerpt: "Self-driving cars with a person sitting behind the wheel is already a reality. Research is being carried out to improve the technology but self-driving cars find it hard during bad weather. Now, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has come up with tech that can help solve this problem."
