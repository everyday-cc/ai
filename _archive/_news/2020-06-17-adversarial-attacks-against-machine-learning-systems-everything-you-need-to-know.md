title: "Adversarial attacks against machine learning systems – everything you need to know"
excerpt: "The technique exploited glitches in the machine learning (ML) algorithms that power Tesla’s Lane Detection technology in order to cause it to behave erratically. Machine learning has become an integral part of many of the applications we use every day – from the facial recognition lock on iPhones to Alexa’s voice recognition function and the spam filters in our emails."

    excerpt: "The human mind has different mechanisms for processing individual pieces of information and sequences. For instance, we have a definition of the word “like.” But we also know that how “like” is used in a sentence depends on the words that come before and after it."
