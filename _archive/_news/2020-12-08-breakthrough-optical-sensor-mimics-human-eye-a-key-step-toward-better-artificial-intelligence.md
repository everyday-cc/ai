  - title: "An eye for an AI: Optic device mimics human retina"
    excerpt: "If our artificial intelligence is able to think like a human brain, why do we feed it data like a normal computer? Scientists are addressing this question by considering the sensory input we human receive and have developed an optical device inspired by the working of the human eye."
