title: "Using machine learning approach to unravel how the brain processes, stores visual information"
excerpt: "Using a machine learning approach, they applied a novel tensor algorithm to decompose faces into a set of components or images called tensorfaces as well as their associated weights, and represented faces by linear combinations of those components. In this way, they build a mathematical model describing the work of the neurons involved in face ..."

    excerpt: "IPA is defined as an evolution of Digital Process Automation (DPA) and is more widely used for Intelligent Document Processing (IDP). Instead of simply using rules-based decision making as per a DPA application, which relies upon structured data, IPA solutions implement approaches such as Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and ..."
