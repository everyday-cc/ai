title: "AI delivers a battery boost to electric vehicles, slashing testing times 98%"
excerpt: "On Tuesday, battery testing for EVs surged forward, thanks to the work of a Stanford-led research team––which used AI to cut testing times by nearly 15fold. Led by Stanford professors Stefano Ermon and William Chueh, the research team, from Stanford, MIT, and the Toyota Research Institute, wanted to come up with the best way to charge an EV ..."

    excerpt: "Artificial intelligence could help to create long-lasting electric vehicle (EV) batteries that charge faster. William Chueh at Stanford University in the US and his colleagues have developed an AI that optimises EV battery recharging while also maximising the battery’s lifespan. “If you want to charge a battery quickly there is an infinite ..."
