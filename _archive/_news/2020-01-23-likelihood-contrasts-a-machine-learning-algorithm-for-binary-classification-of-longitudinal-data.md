title: "Likelihood contrasts: a machine learning algorithm for binary classification of longitudinal data"
excerpt: "Machine learning methods have gained increased popularity in biomedical research during the recent years. However, very few of them support the analysis of longitudinal data, where several samples are collected from an individual over time. Additionally, most of the available longitudinal machine learning methods assume that the measurements ..."
