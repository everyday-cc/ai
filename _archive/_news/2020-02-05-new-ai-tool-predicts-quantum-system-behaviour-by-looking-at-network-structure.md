  - title: "Researchers Create Neural Network to Predict Quantum System Behavior"
    excerpt: "What the Russian researchers did is they replaced the experts with artificial intelligence. They trained the machine to distinguish between networks and tell if a given network will deliver quantum advantage. This pinpoints the networks that are good candidates for building a quantum computer. The team used a neural network geared toward image ..."

  - title: "Moscow: New artificial Intelligence tool predicts the behaviour of a quantum system"
    excerpt: "Moscow: Russian researchers have created an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tool that has learned to predict the behaviour of a quantum system by \"looking\" at its network structure. The neural network autonomously finds solutions that are well-adapted toward quantum advantage demonstrations, according to a study published in the New Journal ..."
