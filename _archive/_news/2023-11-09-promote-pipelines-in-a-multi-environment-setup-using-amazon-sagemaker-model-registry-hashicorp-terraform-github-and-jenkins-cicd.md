    excerpt: "In the recent past, using machine learning (ML) to make predictions, especially for data in the form of text and images, required extensive ML knowledge for creating and tuning of deep learning models. Today, ML has become more accessible to any user who wants to use ML models to generate business value."

  - title: "Explore advanced techniques for hyperparameter optimization with Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning"
    excerpt: "Creating high-performance machine learning (ML) solutions relies on exploring and optimizing training parameters, also known as hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are the knobs and levers that we use to adjust the training process, such as learning rate, batch size, regularization strength, and others,"
