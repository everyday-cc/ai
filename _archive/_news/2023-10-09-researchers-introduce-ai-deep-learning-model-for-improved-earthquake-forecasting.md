  - title: "Researchers develop age prediction model for human brain tissue using artificial intelligence"
    excerpt: "The aging brain undergoes structural and cellular changes that can impact function and increase susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Age acceleration—or the differences between biological and chronological age—in the brain can reveal insights about mechanisms and normal functions of one of the body's most important organs."
