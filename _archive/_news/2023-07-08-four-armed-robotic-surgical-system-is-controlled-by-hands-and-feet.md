title: "Four-armed robotic surgical system is controlled by hands and feet"
excerpt: "Robotic surgical systems such as the da Vinci X are very impressive, with their two arms that are controlled by the surgeon's two hands. An experimental new system takes things even further, though, by adding two more arms controlled by the user's feet. The four-armed laparoscopic setup is being developed by scientists at Switzerland's EPFL research institute."
