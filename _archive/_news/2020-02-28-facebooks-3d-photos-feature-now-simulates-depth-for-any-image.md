title: "Facebook’s 3D Photos feature now simulates depth for any image"
excerpt: "To find the optimal architecture configuration, the 3D Photos team employed an automated process using an algorithm called ChamNet, which was developed by Facebook AI Research. ChamNet iteratively samples points from a search space to train an accuracy predictor, which accelerates the search for a model that maximizes accuracy while satisfying ..."
