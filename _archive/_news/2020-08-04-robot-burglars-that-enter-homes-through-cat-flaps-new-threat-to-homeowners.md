title: "Robot burglars that enter homes through cat flaps, new threat to homeowners"
excerpt: "For many homeowners the traditional way to protect against burglars has been to ensure doors and windows are locked and perhaps even leave a light on. But such gestures might prove futile in years to come after scientists warned that the next generation of home invaders could be robots programmed to gain entry through cat flaps or even letter boxes."
