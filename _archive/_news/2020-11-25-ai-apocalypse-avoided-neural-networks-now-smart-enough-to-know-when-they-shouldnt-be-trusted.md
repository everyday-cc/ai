  - title: "AI Neural Networks Are Now Smart Enough To Know When They Shouldn’t Be Trusted"
    excerpt: "The idea of all-knowing, uncontrollable artificial intelligence (AI) is scary, but if we’re lucky, it looks like AI might just be able to save us from itself. A team of computer scientists from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) say they have created AI neural networks that are able to determine whether they can be trusted,"
