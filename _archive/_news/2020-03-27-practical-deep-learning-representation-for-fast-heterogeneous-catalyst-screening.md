title: "Practical Deep-Learning Representation for Fast Heterogeneous Catalyst Screening"
excerpt: "Recently, comprehensive binding energy prediction machine-learning models have been demonstrated and promise to accelerate the catalyst screening. Here, we present a simple and versatile representation, applicable to any deep-learning models, to further accelerate such process. Our approach involves labeling the binding site atoms of the ..."
