title: "Startup Algoriffix pitches ‘AI as your co-writer’ technology"
excerpt: "The latest startup touting this idea is Algoriffix, which is developing a system that can be used by musicians, composers and producers. ‘AI as your co-writer’ is the slogan, with the suggestion that people “upload your unaccompanied solo or stem and let our algorithms recognise notes and recommend the meter and harmony that fit best your performance”."
