title: "Using AI and natural language processing to predict disease outbreaks earlier"
excerpt: "One of the main areas of focus in such research is spotting possible outbreaks sooner. A new startup in Canada called BlueDot has applied AI and natural language processing to the problem and was one of the first to spot the outbreak of the Wuhan virus in China. The viral outbreak in China, known in the press as the coronavirus, was first ..."
