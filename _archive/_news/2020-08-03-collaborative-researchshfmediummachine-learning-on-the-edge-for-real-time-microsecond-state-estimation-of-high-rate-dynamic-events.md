title: "Collaborative Research:SHF:Medium:Machine Learning on the Edge for Real-Time Microsecond State Estimation of High-Rate Dynamic Events"
excerpt: "This makes it impractical to evaluate FEA models at microsecond timescales. Models derived from machine learning can estimate the state of the system based on pre-curated datasets and require less workload as compared to an equivalent FEA model."
