title: "From models of galaxies to atoms, simple AI shortcuts speed up simulations by billions of times"
excerpt: "Emulators, algorithms that quickly approximate these detailed simulations, offer a shortcut. Now, work posted online shows how artificial intelligence (AI) can easily produce accurate emulators that can accelerate simulations across all of science by billions of times. “This is a big deal,” says Donald Lucas, who runs climate simulations at ..."

    excerpt: "Emulators, based on a form of AI called machine learning, skip the laborious reproduction of nature ... When they were turbocharged with specialized graphical processing chips, they were between about 100,000 and 2 billion times faster than their simulations. That speedup isn't unusual for an emulator, but these were highly accurate: In ..."
