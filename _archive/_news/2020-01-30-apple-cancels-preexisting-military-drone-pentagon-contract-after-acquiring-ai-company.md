title: "Apple cancels preexisting military drone Pentagon contract after acquiring AI company"
excerpt: "So, as The Information reports, when Apple acquired Xnor.ai earlier this month, it immediately canceled the small AI startup’s preexisting Project Maven contract. Xnor.ai’s technology specialized in machine learning algorithms that could be run locally on a device, such as a smartphone—or drone, and thus not need to be connected to the cloud."
