title: "I’m Totally Blind. Artificial Intelligence Is Helping Me Rediscover the World."
excerpt: "Suddenly, I was in a world where nothing was off limits. By simply waving my cellphone, I could hear, with great detail, what my friends were wearing, read street signs and shop prices, analyze a room without having entered it, and indulge in detailed descriptions of the food—one of my great passions—that I was about to eat."
