title: "Machine Learning on the Edge, Hold the Code"
excerpt: "One company that’s attacking the problem in a broad way is Qeexo, which sells an AutoML platform for building and deploying ML applications to microcontrollers without writing a line of code. Qeexo emerged from Carnegie Mellon University in 2012, just at the dawn of the big data age. According to Sang Won Lee, the company’s co-founder and ..."

    excerpt: "ANML scales catastrophic forgetting reduction to a deep learning model with 6 million parameters. It also expands upon OML, a model that was introduced by Martha White and Khurram Javed at NeurIPS 2019 and is capable of completing up to 200 tasks without catastrophic forgetting. But Clune said ANML differs from OML because his team realized ..."
