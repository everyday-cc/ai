title: "How Carrier predicts HVAC faults using AWS Glue and Amazon SageMaker"
excerpt: "In this post, we show how the Carrier and AWS teams applied ML to predict faults across large fleets of equipment using a single model. We first highlight how we use AWS Glue for highly parallel data processing. We then discuss how Amazon SageMaker helps us with feature engineering and building a scalable"

    excerpt: "In this post, we introduce a novel method to perform content moderation on image data with multi-modal pre-training and a large language model (LLM). With multi-modal pre-training, we can directly query the image content based on a set of questions of interest and the model will be able to answer these"
