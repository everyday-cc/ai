title: "There are two sides to the ‘no’ campaign on the Voice. Who are they and why are they opposed to it?"
excerpt: "One side of the “no” campaign comes from the right of politics, including prominent members of the Coalition. With the catch phrase, “ If you don’t know, vote no ”, this camp hopes to impel voters who are unsure about what it all means to just vote no instead of finding the information required."
