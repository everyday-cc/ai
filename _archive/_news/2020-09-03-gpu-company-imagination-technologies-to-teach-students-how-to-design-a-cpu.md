title: "GPU company Imagination Technologies to teach students how to design a CPU"
excerpt: "This does not necessarily bring Imagination back to CPU business right now as it yet has to announce any RISC-V products, but rather demonstrates the company’s interests. The course is called “RVfpga: Understanding Computer Architecture” and it includes theoretical and practical materials to help students understand the basics of processor architecture in general as well as modification or RISC-V cores and microarchitectures."
