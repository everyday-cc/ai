title: "Augment fraud transactions using synthetic data in Amazon SageMaker"
excerpt: "Developing and training successful machine learning (ML) fraud models requires access to large amounts of high-quality data. Sourcing this data is challenging because available datasets are sometimes not large enough or sufficiently unbiased to usefully train the ML model and may require significant"

    excerpt: "Foundation models are large deep learning models trained on a vast quantity of data at scale. They can be further fine-tuned to perform a variety of downstream tasks and form the core backbone of enabling several AI applications. The most prominent category is large-language models (LLM), including&nbsp;auto-regressive"
