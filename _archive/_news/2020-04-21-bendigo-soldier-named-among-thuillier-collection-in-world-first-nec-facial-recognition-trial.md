title: "Bendigo soldier named among Thuillier collection in world-first NEC facial recognition trial"
excerpt: "The glass plates were found in a wooden chest in the family's farmhouse nearly a century later. But none of the subjects could be identified until now. Facial recognition technology has provided the key to finding these soldiers' identities. Electronics company NEC compared the photos to existing Australian War Memorial databases to find matches."
