title: "Watch an AI robot walk with a broken leg, thanks to a brain that never stops learning"
excerpt: "Watch the two simulated robots above, and you’ll notice a big difference. Even though both of their “brains” have evolved over 300 generations to allow them to walk, only one succeeds; the other falls flat on its back."

  - title: "Google develops an AI that can learn both chess and Pac-Man"
    excerpt: "We've developed AIs that can tackle these games, too, but they have had to take a very different approach to the ones that conquered chess and Go. At least until now. Today, however, Google's DeepMind division published a paper describing the structure of an AI that can tackle both chess and Atari classics."
