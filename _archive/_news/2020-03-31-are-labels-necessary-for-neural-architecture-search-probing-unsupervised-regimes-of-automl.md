title: "Are Labels Necessary For Neural Architecture Search? Probing Unsupervised Regimes Of AutoML"
excerpt: "Today hierarchical feature extractors are learned in an end-to-end fashion from data rather than manually designed. NAS is the process of automating architecture engineering, a part of AutoML. NAS can be seen as a subfield of AutoML and has significant overlap with hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. Researchers exploit the ..."
