title: "Canadian officials in Albany talk Global Entry, AI"
excerpt: "ALBANY â€” About 400,000 people and $2 billion worth of goods and services pass between the United States and Canada every day. But there are concerns that flow may slow in New York after last week's decision by the Department of Homeland Security to temporarily bar residents in the state from enrolling in the Global Entry program that expedited processing through border checkpoints for pre-screened travelers."
