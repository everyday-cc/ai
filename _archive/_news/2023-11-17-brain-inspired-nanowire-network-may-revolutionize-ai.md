title: "Brain-Inspired Nanowire Network May Revolutionize AI"
excerpt: "However, todayâ€™s standard computing hardware architecture is not, hence running AI on conventional hardware is currently energy inefficient. Exciting new research may help bridge this gap. A study by researchers at the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI) at UCLA along with their collaborators at the University of Sydney show a brain-inspired nanowire network AI computing system that can identify handwritten numbers with high accuracy."
