title: "Tesla 'full self-driving' comes under fire: 'This is actively misleading people'"
excerpt: "Tesla sent out its “full self-driving” software to a small group of owners who will test it on public roads. The conflicting messages have experts in the field accusing Tesla of deceptive, irresponsible marketing that could make the roads more dangerous as the system is rolled out to as many as 1 million electric vehicle drivers by the end of the year."
