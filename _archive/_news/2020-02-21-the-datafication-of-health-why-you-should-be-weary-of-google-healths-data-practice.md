title: "The datafication of health — Why you should be weary of Google Health’s data practice"
excerpt: "In 2017, the UK deemed a partnership between Google’s health subsidiary DeepMind and the National Health Service illegal for “overly broad sharing of data” (Simonite 2017). DeepMind was later absorbed by Google Health, despite Google’s previous assertion to keep its Health division separate from Google’s core services (King 2019)."
