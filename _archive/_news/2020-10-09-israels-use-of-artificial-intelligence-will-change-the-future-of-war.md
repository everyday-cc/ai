title: "Israel’s Use of Artificial Intelligence Will Change the Future of War"
excerpt: "War is always going to be fought with people and weapons. It is also always going to involve “platforms,” such as tanks and the capabilities they have. It is important to understand that in discussions of the future of warfare the issue is not just about the person or the platform but also tying it all together."
