title: "Pollen measurement system developed at TU Graz analyses fast, cheaply and automatically"
excerpt: "Machine learning algorithms analyse the pollen Up to 100 microscopic images are uploaded to the cloud in 30 seconds. An object recognition software identifies and classifies the pollen grains on the basis of various characteristics. In field trials, the pollen recognition model correctly recognized pollen in 90 percent of cases. In order to be ..."
