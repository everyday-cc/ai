title: "Researchers Create Neural Network to Predict Quantum System Behavior"
excerpt: "What the Russian researchers did is they replaced the experts with artificial intelligence. They trained the machine to distinguish between networks and tell if a given network will deliver quantum advantage. This pinpoints the networks that are good candidates for building a quantum computer. The team used a neural network geared toward image ..."
