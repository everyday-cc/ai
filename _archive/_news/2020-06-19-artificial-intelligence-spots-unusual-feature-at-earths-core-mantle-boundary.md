title: "Artificial intelligence spots unusual feature at Earth’s core-mantle boundary"
excerpt: "An artificial intelligence algorithm originally developed for astrophysics has revealed a previously unknown feature on the core-mantle boundary deep inside the Earth. The algorithm allowed researchers in the US to find patterns in seemingly unconnected seismic data from different sources and the team believes that the new technique could glean insights from other types of geophysical datasets in future."
