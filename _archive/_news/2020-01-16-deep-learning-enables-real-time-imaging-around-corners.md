title: "Deep learning enables real-time imaging around corners"
excerpt: "Researchers have harnessed the power of a type of artificial intelligence known as deep learning to create a new laser-based system that can image around corners in real time. With further development, the system might let self-driving cars \"look\" around parked cars or busy intersections to see hazards or pedestrians. It could also be installed ..."
