title: "IAG pushes AI to predict costly car repairs"
excerpt: "Insurance Australia Group (IAG) is using natural language processing technology to predict within days if a damaged car is likely to be too expensive to repair and therefore declared a total loss. Chief analytics officer Bora Arslan told FST Media’s Future of Financial Services Sydney 2020 conference that the total loss prediction use case is but one of a number of examples where “scaled AI” technology is being applied in its operations."
