title: "A reliable time-series method for predicting arthritic disease outcomes: New step from regression toward a nonlinear artificial intelligence method."
excerpt: "Objectives of this study were to verify, with an artificial intelligence-based nonlinear approach, if the estimation of ITS data could be facilitated, in addition to providing a computationally explicit equation. Dataset were from a study of Hawley et al. (2018) in which they evaluated the impact of UK National Institute for Health and Care ..."
