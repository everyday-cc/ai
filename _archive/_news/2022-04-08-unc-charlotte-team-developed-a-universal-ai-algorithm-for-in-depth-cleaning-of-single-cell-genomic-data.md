title: "UNC Charlotte team developed a universal AI algorithm for in-depth cleaning of single cell genomic data"
excerpt: "Over the past decade, single cell RNA sequencing has been a key tool in biomedical research, despite its very noisy and difficult to interpret data. A new algorithm to clean the data ensures the sequencing information is usable,"
