  - title: "Google Brain and DeepMind researchers attack reinforcement learning efficiency"
    excerpt: "Unfortunately, it’s data-intensive, which motivated research teams — one from Google Brain (one of Google’s AI research divisions) and the other from Alphabet’s DeepMind — to prototype more efficient means of executing it. In a pair of preprint papers, the researchers propose Adaptive Behavior Policy Sharing (ABPS), an algorithm that ..."

  - title: "Using machine learning to solve real-world data problems for scientists and engineers"
    excerpt: "Many researchers in artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to develop computer programs that can sift through huge amounts of data, learn from it, and guide future decisions. But, what if the many data options are hugely expensive and difficult to acquire and one has to decide which data is best to spend your money on? What direction ..."
