title: "Returning to experiments with Machine Learning and the Premier League: Relative Performance"
excerpt: "Following on from this piece where I was experimenting with machine learning in Python to predict performance of teams in the English Premier League (EPL), as promised I have been been running the script after each round of games to produce a predictive table. During this time I made some observations and some additions to the model due to the ..."
