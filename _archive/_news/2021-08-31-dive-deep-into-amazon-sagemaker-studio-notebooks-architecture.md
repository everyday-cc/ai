title: "Dive deep into Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks architecture"
excerpt: "Machine learning (ML) is highly iterative and complex in nature, and requires data scientists to explore multiple ways in which a business problem can be solved. Data scientists have to use tools that support interactive experimentation so you can run code, review its outputs, and annotate it, which"
