  - title: "New AI technology turns 2D pics into 3D scenes"
    excerpt: "When the first instant photo was takenÂ 75 years ago with a Polaroid camera, it was groundbreaking to rapidly capture the 3D world in a realistic 2D image. Today, AI researchers are working on the opposite: turning a collection of still images into a digital 3D scene in a matter of seconds."
