title: "Exploring Nuances Of Machine Learning & Personalization In Apps"
excerpt: "The market for machine learning is projected to reach $20.8 billion by 2024. It is unbelievable that it was only worth $1.6 billion back in 2017. This means that the market has been growing around 45% a year over the course of a decade. The rapid growth in the machine learning market is largely attributed to the growing list of applications for it."
