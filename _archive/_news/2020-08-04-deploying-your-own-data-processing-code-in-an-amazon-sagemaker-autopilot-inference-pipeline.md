title: "Deploying your own data processing code in an Amazon SageMaker Autopilot inference pipeline"
excerpt: "The machine learning (ML) model-building process requires data scientists to manually prepare data features, select an appropriate algorithm, and optimize its model parameters. It involves a lot of effort and expertise. Amazon SageMaker Autopilot removes the heavy lifting required by this ML process."

    excerpt: "There are many techniques to train deep learning models with a small amount of data. Examples include transfer learning, few-shot learning, or even one-shot learning for an image classification task and fine-tuning for language models based on a pre-trained BERT or GPT2 model. However, you may still"
