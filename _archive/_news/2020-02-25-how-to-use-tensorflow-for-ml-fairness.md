title: "How To Use TensorFlow For ML Fairness"
excerpt: "Today, they came up with a package that can help developers build models to constrain the metrics using TensorFlow. Metrics in a machine learning context can mean many things. Here are a few examples: TFCO is mainly developed, wrote the developers, is to mitigate creation and optimisation constrained problems. It is easy because these problems ..."
