title: "Self-driving cars could become the living rooms of the future"
excerpt: "And that's appealing to many who already know they want to sleep, send emails or play video games as they zip down the road in a car that operates itself. With self-driving vehicles on the horizon, automakers are rethinking what the future of car interiors will look like. And because these completely autonomous cars, called Level 5 vehicles ..."
