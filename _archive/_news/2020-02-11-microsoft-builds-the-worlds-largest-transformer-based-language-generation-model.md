title: "Microsoft builds the world's largest transformer-based language generation model"
excerpt: "that outperforms the state of the art models available today on many downstream natural language processing (NLP) applications. To train the model, researchers at Microsoft trained their model on an NVIDIA DGX-2 system housing multiple NVIDIA V100 GPUs that were interconnected with InfiniBand. The type of training data used was similar to the ..."

    excerpt: "Let’s see if more parameters mean better results, compared to OpenAI’s GPT-2 and NVIDIA’s Megatron-LM. Turing Natural Language Generation, short Turing-NLG, is a new deep learning language model developed by Microsoft. It was announced on the Microsoft Research Blog. The transformer-based model Turing-NLG can not only generate texts and ..."
