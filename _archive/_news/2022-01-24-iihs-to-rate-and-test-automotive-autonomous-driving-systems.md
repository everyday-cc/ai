title: "IIHS to Rate and Test Automotive Autonomous Driving Systems"
excerpt: "To earn a good rating, systems will need to ensure that the driverâ€™s eyes are directed at the road and their hands are either on the wheel or ready to grab it at all times. Escalating alerts and appropriate emergency procedures when the driver does not meet those conditions will also be required."
