  - title: "Google Reportedly Working on AI-powered Search Engine"
    excerpt: "AI chatbots pose a serious threat to Google's core business model, which is selling ads on your search queries. If you stop looking to traditional search engines and prefer to ask a chatbot to answer questions directly, that means you're doing less Googling and visiting websites. Many webpages often have ads placed by Google as well."
