title: "Scientists Linked Artificial and Biological Neurons in a Network—and Amazingly, It Worked"
excerpt: "As Moore’s law is dying, we even said that neuromorphic computing is one path towards the future of extremely powerful, low energy consumption artificial neural network-based computing—in hardware—that could in theory better link up with the brain. Because the chips “speak” the brain’s language, in theory they could become ..."
