title: "Study: Artificial Intelligence Can Improve MRI Detection of ADHD"
excerpt: "Some studies suggest that a disrupted or interrupted connectome is linked to ADHD. Most research so far has involved the “single-channel deep neural network” (scDNN) model, where artificial intelligence helps a computer construct connectomes based on one parcellation. In this study, scientists developed a “multichannel deep neural network ..."
