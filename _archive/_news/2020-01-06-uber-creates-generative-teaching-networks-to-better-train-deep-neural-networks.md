title: "Uber Creates Generative Teaching Networks to Better Train Deep Neural Networks"
excerpt: "The generator and the learner networks are trained with meta-learning via nested optimization that consists of inner and outer training loops. In the GTN model, the generator produces completely new artificial data that a never-seen-before learner neural network (with a randomly sampled architecture and weight initialization) trains on for a ..."
