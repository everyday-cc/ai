title: "Two Ground-breaking PhD Offers In Physics (Machine Learning At The LHC)"
excerpt: "Machine Learning for HEP In addition to all of that, if you are interested in machine learning applied to physics, there I am. I have been a pioneer in these techniques for data analysis in CDF and CMS, and I am still actively working on a few lines of research which might inspire an outstanding Ph.D. thesis. Let me mention two things I have ..."
