title: "Some of Boston’s neighbors have banned facial surveillance. Now, the city council is moving to follow suit."
excerpt: "Boston isn’t currently using facial recognition technology. And the city council is looking to keep it that way for the foreseeable future. During a video conference hearing Wednesday afternoon, Councilors Michelle Wu and Ricardo Arroyo introduced an ordinance to ban the city and its police department from using any face surveillance system — or information derived from such technology — due to concerns about racial bias and the infringement of civil liberties."
