title: "How much of the vacuuming can you leave to a £200 robot cleaner?"
excerpt: "After nearly two decades of trying to clean up, it would be nice to think that robotic vacuums had by now relieved us of at least one household chore. Sadly, that’s not quite the case – but a modest outlay can at least reduce your reliance on your regular Hoover and let you do some of the tidying up from the comfort of your armchair."
