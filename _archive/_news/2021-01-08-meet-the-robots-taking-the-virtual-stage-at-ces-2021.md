title: "Meet the robots taking the virtual stage at CES 2021"
excerpt: "This year's all-digital CES is going to be a tough one for everyone involved, but it may be even harder if you're a robot. Robots can pique people's interest via the written word or videos, but there's nothing like showing people what you can do in person to really make a good first impression."
