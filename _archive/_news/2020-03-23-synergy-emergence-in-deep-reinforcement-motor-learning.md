title: "Synergy emergence in deep reinforcement motor learning"
excerpt: "Now, researchers at Tohoku University have observed a similar concept in robotic agents using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. DRL allows robotic agents to learn the best action possible in their virtual environment. It allows complex robotic tasks to be solved whilst minimalising manual operations and achieving peak performance."
