title: "This new AI model will badmouth you for putting trash in the wrong bin"
excerpt: "When Iâ€™m at airports, I often get confused as to which trash and recycling bin I should throw my rubbish into. A new solution from a Canadian AI company, Initutaive AI, might come in handy. The firm has developed Oscar, an image-detection based AI, that recognizes objects in your hand and guides you to put things in correct bins."
