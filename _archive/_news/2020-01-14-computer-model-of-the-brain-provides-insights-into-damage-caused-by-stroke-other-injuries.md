title: "Computer model of the brain provides insights into damage caused by stroke, other injuries"
excerpt: "\"For this reason, non-linear methods like MVPA have been at the core of so-called 'Deep Learning' approaches behind technologies, such as the computer vision software required for self-driving cars.\" But MVPA uses brute force machine-learning techniques. The process is opportunistic, sometimes confusing coincidence with correlation. Even ideal ..."
