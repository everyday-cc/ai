title: "Machine Learning Analysis for Quantitative Discrimination of Dried Blood Droplets"
excerpt: "We objectively and quantitatively analysed 1800 images of dried blood droplets, developing sophisticated image processing analysis routines and optimising a multivariate statistical machine learning algorithm. We looked for statistically relevant correlations between the patterns in the dried blood droplets and exercise-induced changes in blood ..."
