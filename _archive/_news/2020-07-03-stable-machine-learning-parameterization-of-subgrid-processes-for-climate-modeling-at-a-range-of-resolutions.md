title: "Stable machine-learning parameterization of subgrid processes for climate modeling at a range of resolutions"
excerpt: "Machine learning has been used to represent small-scale processes, such as clouds, in atmospheric models but this can lead to instability in simulations of climate. Here, the authors demonstrate a use of machine learning in an atmospheric model that leads to stable simulations of climate at a range of grid spacings."
