    excerpt: "Next month, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles will release the latest batch of reports from companies testing self-driving vehicles in the state. But the reports offer, at best, a flawed glimpse into the slow and often opaque process of testing autonomous vehicles on public roads, says Kyle Vogt, co-founder and CTO of GM-based Cruise."

    excerpt: "Russia's Yandex and China's Baidu have programmed cars to stop at streetlights ... The cars might have different logos and sensors on them, but underneath, they’re the same. So what cars are self-driving companies using? Qualcomm is building an advanced driving system that is basically autonomous, but still keeps the human driver in charge."
