  - title: "Google and Seagate think they can tell when your HDD will fail"
    excerpt: "Google Cloud and Seagate has devised a machine learning (ML) system to predict when disks inside Googleâ€™s data centers might fail. Despite their volatility and high fail rates, hard disk drives (HDD) are the preferred means of housing data inside a data center."

  - title: "Google and Seagate use AI to predict hard drive failures"
    excerpt: "The team tested two different AI models to predict which hard drives would fail, and found that an automated machine learning (AutoML) model worked better than a custom system, giving 98 percent precision - while also enabling Google to find new rules ..."
