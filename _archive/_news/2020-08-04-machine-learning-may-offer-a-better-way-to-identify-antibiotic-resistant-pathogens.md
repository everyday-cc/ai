title: "Machine learning may offer a better way to identify antibiotic-resistant pathogens"
excerpt: "Biomedical engineers at Duke University have shown that different strains of the same bacterial pathogen can be distinguished by a machine learning analysis of their growth dynamics alone, which can then also accurately predict other traits such as resistance to antibiotics."
