title: "GM and Honda unveil self-driving car with no steering wheel or pedals"
excerpt: "(CNN) -- GM and Honda, automakers with more than 160 years of experience between them, have thrown tradition out the window by unveiling the Origin, a new self-driving vehicle. The six-seat electric vehicle has no steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals, windshield wipers or rear view mirror. Its doors slide rather than swing open."
