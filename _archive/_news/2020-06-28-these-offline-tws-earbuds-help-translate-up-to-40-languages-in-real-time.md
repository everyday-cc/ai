title: "These offline TWS earbuds help translate up to 40 languages in real-time"
excerpt: "The Timekettle M2, in that regard, aren’t your standard TWS earbuds. Sure, they’re meant for listening to music and podcasts, or giving commands to your phone’s voice AI, but their prime feature is the ability to foster a multi-lingual two-way conversation by allowing two people to wear one earphone each as the M2’s on-board translation engine seamlessly fills in the gaps."
