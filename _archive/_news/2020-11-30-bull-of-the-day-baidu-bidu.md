title: "Bull of the Day: Baidu (BIDU)"
excerpt: "After peaking above $270 in 2018, Baidu (BIDU) shares have been stuck in bull market purgatory, spending most of the last 18 months under $140. That punishment could be ending soon as the company reinvents itself and recovers from government restrictions on its advertising revenues."
