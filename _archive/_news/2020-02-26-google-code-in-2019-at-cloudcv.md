title: "Google Code-In 2019 at CloudCV"
excerpt: "When I decided I would participate, I had no idea about open source development whatsoever (yes, ZERO). And cherry on the cake, I had no idea about any org (this was before TensorFlow was announced as an org). To know more about the contest, I dived in early. I took a look at the orgs from previous years and checked example tasks from the archive."
