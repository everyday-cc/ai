title: "Brain magnetic resonance imaging enhanced through artificial intelligence: Study"
excerpt: "This new model manages to increase image quality from low resolution to high resolution without distorting the patients' brain structures, using a deep learning artificial neural network-a model that is based on the functioning of the human brain- that \"learns\" this process. The study was published in the scientific journal Neurocomputing."
