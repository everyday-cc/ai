title: "Accelerate PyTorch with DeepSpeed to train large language models with Intel Habana Gaudi-based DL1 EC2 instances"
excerpt: "Training large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters can be challenging. In addition to designing the model architecture, researchers need to set up state-of-the-art training techniques for distributed training like mixed precision support, gradient accumulation, and checkpointing. With"
