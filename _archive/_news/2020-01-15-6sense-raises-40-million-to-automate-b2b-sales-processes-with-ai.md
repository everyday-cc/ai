title: "6Sense raises $40 million to automate B2B sales processes with AI"
excerpt: "The company claimed revenue grew by 100% in 2018, the year that marked its acquisition of AI startup ZenIQ, and that the growth continued well into 2019. “As a startup, a company can sell via personal relationships and word of mouth. In the scale-up growth phase, the equivalent is account-based marketing and sales,” said Lieberman."
