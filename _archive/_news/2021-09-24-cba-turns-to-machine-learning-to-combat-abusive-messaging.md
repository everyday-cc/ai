title: "CBA turns to machine learning to combat abusive messaging"
excerpt: "The Commonwealth Bank of Australia has built machine learning models to scan for abusive patterns of behaviour and language in transaction descriptions. The response is the latest in a series of actions being pursued by the major banks after it was discovered in 2020 that some customers were being barraged with large numbers of low-value transactions that contained abusive language or threats in the description field of those payments."
