  - title: "Scientists make artificial and biological neurons communicate over the internet"
    excerpt: "But scientists in the U.K., Switzerland, Germany, and Italy are here to remind you that it really isn’t. In a recent experiment, the researchers fired up a working neural network that let biological and silicon-based artificial brain cells communicate with one another over an internet connection. At present, it’s still early stages for the ..."

  - title: "Artificial neurons now talking to real neurons with hope of creating a hybrid brain network"
    excerpt: "In focal brain diseases, a patient’s neural network loses key connections, preventing the brain from functioning as it miraculously should. But what if there was a way to restore those connections? An EU funded study is seeking to do just that by getting real biological neurons to synaptically communicate with artificial ones. Though still ..."
