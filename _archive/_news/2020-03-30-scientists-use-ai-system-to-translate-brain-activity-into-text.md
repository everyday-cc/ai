title: "Scientists use AI system to translate brain activity into text"
excerpt: "A new AI system that converts brain activity into text could transform communication for people who can’t speak or type. The mind-reading machine uses brain implants to track what neurons do when someone speaks. An algorithm then converts the data into a string of numbers, which another system then translates into a sequence of words."

    excerpt: "the algorithmic translation of text from one language to another,\" the scientists wrote in a new paper published in the scientific journal Nature Neuroscience. They've taken an AI approach that is akin to translating text in different languages. The underlying theory is the same in both cases—the goal is to convert one sequence of some arbitr ..."
