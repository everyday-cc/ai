  - title: "AI can detect if you have coronavirus by listening to the sound of your cough"
    excerpt: "Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) system which they claim can detect coronavirus by analysing the sound of people coughing. Scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) said the AI works because  the virus causes temporary neuromuscular impairment which can cause small differences to people’s speech or the sound of their cough - even if they have no other symptoms."
