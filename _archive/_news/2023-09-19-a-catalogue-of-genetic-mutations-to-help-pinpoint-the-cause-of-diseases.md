title: "A catalogue of genetic mutations to help pinpoint the cause of diseases"
excerpt: "We've released a catalogue of ‘missense’ mutations where researchers can learn more about what effect they may have. Missense variants are genetic mutations that can affect the function of human proteins. In some cases, they can lead to diseases such as cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell anaemia, or cancer."

  - title: "AI Tool Pinpoints Genetic Mutations That Cause Disease"
    excerpt: "Google DeepMind has wielded its revolutionary protein-structure-prediction AI in the hunt for genetic mutations that cause disease. A new tool based on the AlphaFold network can accurately predict which mutations in proteins are likely to cause health conditions — a challenge that limits the use of genomics in healthcare."
