title: "‘If two people are happy in same – sex marriage, why should anyone object?’"
excerpt: "Priti Rani, a 44-year-old Dalit woman who works as a help in a Bathinda office was not even aware of LGBT, let alone knowing about same-sex marriage until two years ago. But on Tuesday, even she, who studied till class 12, waited impatiently for the Supreme Court decision on same sex marriage, a concept that was alien to her just years ago."
