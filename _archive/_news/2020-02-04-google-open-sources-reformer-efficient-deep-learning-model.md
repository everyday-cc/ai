title: "Google Open-Sources Reformer Efficient Deep-Learning Model"
excerpt: "Researchers from Google AI recently open-sourced the Reformer, a more efficient version of the Transformer deep-learning model. Using a hashing trick for attention calculation and reversible residual layers, the Reformer can handle text sequences up to 1 million words while consuming only 16GB of memory on a single GPU accelerator. With such a ..."

  - title: "Efficient Model Selection for Deep Neural Networks on Massively Parallel Processing Databases"
    excerpt: "In this session we will present an efficient way to train many deep learning model configurations at the same time with Greenplum, a free and open source massively parallel database based on PostgreSQL. The implementation involves distributing data to the workers that have GPUs available and hopping model state between those workers ..."
