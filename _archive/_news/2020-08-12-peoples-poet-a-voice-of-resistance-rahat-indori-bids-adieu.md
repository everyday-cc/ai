title: "People’s poet, a voice of resistance, Rahat Indori bids adieu"
excerpt: "Rahat Indori, who died in Indore on Tuesday, was one of the most prominent faces of Urdu poetry and a poet who had a rare connect with the masses, a people’s poet in the true sense. He could come and conquer a mushaira --either held in a classy auditorium or in a faraway town where thousands of people waited till midnight to listen to his poetry."
