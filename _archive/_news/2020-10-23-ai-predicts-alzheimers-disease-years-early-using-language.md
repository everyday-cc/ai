title: "AI Predicts Alzheimer’s Disease Years Early using Language"
excerpt: "Can linguistics, the scientific study of language, be used to detect Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in cognitively normal people using artificial intelligence (AI)? Scientists from IBM Research and Pfizer created a novel machine learning model that can predict the onset of Alzheimer’s disease years in advance based on linguistics,"

  - title: "The AI that spots Alzheimer's from cookie drawing"
    excerpt: "A dated line drawing of two children stealing cookies behind their mother's back is being used by an artificial intelligence system to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The system uses voice samples of people describing the scene to predict whether healthy people may get the disease."
