title: "Code-free machine learning: AutoML with AutoGluon, Amazon SageMaker, and AWS Lambda"
excerpt: "One of AWS’s goals is to put machine learning (ML) in the hands of every developer. With the open-source AutoML library AutoGluon, deployed using Amazon SageMaker and AWS Lambda, we can take this a step further, putting ML in the hands of anyone who wants to make predictions based on data—no prior programming"

    excerpt: "There are many techniques to train deep learning models with a small amount of data. Examples include transfer learning, few-shot learning, or even one-shot learning for an image classification task and fine-tuning for language models based on a pre-trained BERT or GPT2 model. However, you may still"
