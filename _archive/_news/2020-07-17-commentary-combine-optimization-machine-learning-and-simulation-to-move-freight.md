title: "Commentary: Combine optimization, machine learning and simulation to move freight"
excerpt: "On July 7, FreightWaves ran Commentary: Optimal Dynamics – the decision layer of logistics?, which kicked off a series that will focus on “AI in Supply Chain.” I believe that the incorporation of decision-making technologies in the supply chain is potentially the most transformative development in global industrial supply chains that we will see for the next two or three decades."
