title: "Learning a Deep Dual Attention Network for Video Super-Resolution"
excerpt: "Abstract: Recently, deep learning based video super-resolution (SR) methods combine the convolutional neural networks (CNN) with motion compensation to estimate a high-resolution (HR) video from its low-resolution (LR) counterpart. However, most previous methods conduct downscaling motion estimation to handle large motions, which can lead to ..."
