  - title: "New x-ray microscopy technique could help accelerate efforts to map neural circuits"
    excerpt: "One of the grand quests in neuroscience is to build a precise map of the brain, charting all its neurons and the connections between them. Such a wiring diagram, called a connectome, promises to help shed light on how a collection of cells can together give rise to thoughts,"
