title: "Catching sesame oil adulteration, with machine learning"
excerpt: "Now, researchers from Yanshan University in China have developed a technique to speed up the testing of sesame oil samples based on a combination of 3D fluorescence spectroscopy and machine learning using AlexNet, a convolutional neural network or CNN. 3D fluorescence spectroscopy is already becoming a go-to technology for analysing oil samples ..."
