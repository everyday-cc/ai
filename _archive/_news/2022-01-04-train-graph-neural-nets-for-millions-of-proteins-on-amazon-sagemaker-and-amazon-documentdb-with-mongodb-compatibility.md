title: "Train graph neural nets for millions of proteins on Amazon SageMaker and Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)"
excerpt: "There are over 180,000 unique proteins with 3D structures determined, with tens of thousands new structures resolved every year. This is only a small fraction of the 200 million known proteins with distinctive sequences. Recent deep learning algorithms such as AlphaFold can accurately predict 3D structures"
