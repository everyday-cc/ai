title: "Three Ways To Prepare For The AI-Enabled Future"
excerpt: "Technically speaking, AI can and probably will replace many professions. Compared to a human, AI is faster and smarter.

  - title: "Poised to profit from emerging world of AI"
    excerpt: "Since only a portion of a company’s shares are typically sold via an IPO, the rest remain in the hands of insiders or private investors. When those folks cash in their shares – with the proceeds going to the sellers, not the company – it’s generally referred to as a secondary offering."
