title: "Using machine learning to better understand how water behaves"
excerpt: "New research uses machine learning models to better understand water's phase changes, opening more avenues for a better theoretical understanding of various substances. With this technique, the researchers found strong computational evidence in support of water's liquid-liquid transition that can be applied to real-world systems that use water to operate."
