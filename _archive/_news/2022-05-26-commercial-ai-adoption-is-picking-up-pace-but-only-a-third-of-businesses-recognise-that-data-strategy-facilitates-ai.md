title: "Commercial AI Adoption is Picking Up Pace But Only A Third of Businesses Recognise that Data Strategy Facilitates AI"
excerpt: "Most businesses (90%) now use or plan to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and even more (98%) have, or intend to, implement a data strategy.

  - title: "This Facial Recognition Site Is Creeping Everyone Out"
    excerpt: "A facial recognition tool called PimEyes has recently gone from unknown to infamous. PimEyes makes it easy to find pictures of people that are strewn across the internet.
