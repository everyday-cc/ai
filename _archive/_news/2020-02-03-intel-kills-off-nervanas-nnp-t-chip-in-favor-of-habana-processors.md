title: "Intel kills off Nervana's NNP-T chip in favor of Habana processors"
excerpt: "The move comes after Intel spent $2 billion on acquiring Habana Labs, a start-up that makes more powerful chips. All development has ceased on the NNP-T AI training chip, while the NNP-I inference chip will be delivered to previously committed customers, before development is also ceased. The move appears to have been a sudden one, with Intel ..."
