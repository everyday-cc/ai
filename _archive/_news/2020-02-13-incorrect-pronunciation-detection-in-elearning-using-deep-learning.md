title: "Incorrect Pronunciation Detection in eLearning using Deep Learning"
excerpt: "At a high level, the idea is to monitor pronunciation of end-user, perform an analysis on it and feed the analysis back to them so that they can work on it to improve and also record it for deep learning. This can be achieved with an add-on or separate system that enables students/user to improve their pronunciation skills, not limited to ..."

    excerpt: "But Apple thinks it can improve location accuracy by applying machine learning to Kalman estimation filters, a just-published patent application reveals. The basic concept is that while navigation systems generally rely on live location-determining pings from multiple satellites â€” a process that can take precious time, during which the ..."
