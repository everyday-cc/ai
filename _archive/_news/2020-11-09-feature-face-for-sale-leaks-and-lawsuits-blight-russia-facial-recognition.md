title: "FEATURE-Face for sale: Leaks and lawsuits blight Russia facial recognition"
excerpt: "When Anna Kuznetsova saw an ad offering access to Moscow's face recognition cameras, all she had to do was pay 16,000 roubles ($200) and send a photo of the person she wanted spying on. The 20-year-old - who was acting as a volunteer for a digital rights group investigating leaks in Moscow's pervasive surveillance system - sent over a picture of herself and waited."
