title: "Tesla's Self-Driving Business Is Powering Ahead Despite Setbacks"
excerpt: "The run-up is partly due to Tesla’s solid execution, with deliveries for this year poised to grow by almost 70% to about 850,000 vehicles, despite the ongoing semiconductor shortage. Tesla’s sizable lead in the self-driving market has also traditionally been a very big driver of the company’s valuation."
