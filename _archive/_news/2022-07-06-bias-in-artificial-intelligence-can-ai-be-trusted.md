title: "Bias in Artificial Intelligence: Can AI be Trusted?"
excerpt: "Microsoft released the Microsoft Responsible AI Standard, v2 ( PDF ). Its stated purpose is to “define product development requirements for responsible AI”. Perhaps surprisingly, the document contains only one mention of bias in artificial intelligence (AI): algorithm developers need to be aware of the potential for users to over-rely on AI outputs (known as ‘automation bias’)."
