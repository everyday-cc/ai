title: "Student invents program to let deaf people see speech in text bubbles"
excerpt: "Industrial designer Dalik Samkai, who was diagnosed with hearing loss when he was 17 years old, decided to use the skills he acquired at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design to create Blubbles, an augmented reality (AG) solution that allows people to see the faces of those around them and read their spoken words as if they were text balloons in a comic strip."
