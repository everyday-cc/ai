title: "Image Clustering via Deep Embedded Dimensionality Reduction and Probability-Based Triplet Loss"
excerpt: "Abstract: Image clustering is more challenging than image classification. Without supervised information, current deep learning methods are difficult to be directly applied to image clustering problems. Image clustering needs to deal with three main problems: 1) the curse of dimensionality caused by high-dimensional image data; 2) extracting ..."
