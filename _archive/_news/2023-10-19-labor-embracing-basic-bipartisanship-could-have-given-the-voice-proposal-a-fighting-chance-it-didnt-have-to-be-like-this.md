title: "Labor embracing basic bipartisanship could have given the Voice proposal a fighting chance: 'It didn't have to be like this'"
excerpt: "Labor foolishly thought they could steal a glorious moment in history for themselves and thus refused to entertain any amendment to the proposal. This fundamental misreading of reality will reverberate long into the future. It has also been claimed that the Voice proposal was “denied” bipartisan support by the Coalition."
