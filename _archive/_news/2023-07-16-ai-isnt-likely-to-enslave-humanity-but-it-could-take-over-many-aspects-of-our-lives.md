title: "AI Isn’t Likely To Enslave Humanity, But It Could Take Over Many Aspects Of Our Lives"
excerpt: "Office supplies or dinner, the basic idea is the same: AI is fast becoming an alien intelligence, good at accomplishing goals but dangerous because it won’t necessarily align with the moral values of its creators. And, in its most extreme version, this argument morphs into explicit anxieties about AIs enslaving or destroying the human race."
