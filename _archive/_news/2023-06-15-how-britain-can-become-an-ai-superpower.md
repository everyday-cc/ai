title: "How Britain can become an AI superpower"
excerpt: "For Britain to prosper in AI, therefore, much will have to change. It needs to cram more people who know one end of a GPU from the other into positions of influence in government. Mr Sunak may loudly extol the promise of Brit GPT, but his government should include more engineers who understand the mix of data and compute from which AI is built."
