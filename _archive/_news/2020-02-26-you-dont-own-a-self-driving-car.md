  - title: "How to build an ethical self-driving car"
    excerpt: "Not too long ago, tech enthusiasts were telling us that by 2020, we would see self-driving cars hit the mainstream, with some 10 million on the roads. That turned out to be a wild overestimation. The actual number of vehicles in testing is thousands of times smaller, and these are still being driven mostly in controlled conditions. Companies ..."
