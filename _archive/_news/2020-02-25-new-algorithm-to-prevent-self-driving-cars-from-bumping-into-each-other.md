title: "New algorithm to prevent self-driving cars from bumping into each other"
excerpt: "Researchers have developed a novel algorithm that may allow collision-free transportation in autonomous vehicles, an advance which they claim can help self-driving cars navigate each other without crashing, or causing traffic jams.The study, published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Robotics, tested the algorithm in a simulation of 1,024 ..."

  - title: "How to build an ethical self-driving car"
    excerpt: "Not too long ago, tech enthusiasts were telling us that by 2020, we would see self-driving cars hit the mainstream, with some 10 million on the roads. That turned out to be a wild overestimation. The actual number of vehicles in testing is thousands of times smaller, and these are still being driven mostly in controlled conditions. Companies ..."

    excerpt: "Self-driving cars with a person sitting behind the wheel is already a reality. Research is being carried out to improve the technology but self-driving cars find it hard during bad weather. Now, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has come up with tech that can help solve this problem."
