title: "VCSEL used in novel photonic neural network"
excerpt: "Photonic neural network systems, which are fast and energy efficient, are helpful for dealing with large amounts of data. To advance photonic brain-like computing technologies, a group of researchers at the University of Strathclyde combined a spike-based neural network with a VCSEL that exhibits spiking neuronal behaviours."
