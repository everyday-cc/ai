title: "Infrared spectroscopy data- and physics-driven machine learning for characterizing surface microstructure of complex materials"
excerpt: "There is no physical model that allows adsorption site prediction from a single set of frequencies and intensities. Learning surface microstructure is further complicated by the fact that there are many CO molecules adsorbed on an ensemble of sites. We quantify microstructure with both binding-type (a discrete distribution) and GCN (a nearly ..."
