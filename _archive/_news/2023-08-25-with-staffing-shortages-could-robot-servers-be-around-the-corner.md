title: "With staffing shortages, could robot servers be around the corner?"
excerpt: "“The robot allows our servers to spend more of their time inside the restaurant,” said Jaime Smith, Splendido’s director of dining services, in a statement. “For example, if the kitchen has two tables’ meals ready at the same time, the robot can deliver one while the server takes the other. It doubles the staffing for those moments.”"
