title: "Artificial Intelligence system created to allows self-driving cars to 'see' around corners"
excerpt: "An artificial intelligence system that allows self-driving cars to 'see' around corners in real time could help prevent accidents, according to its developers. Researchers from Stanford University in the USA have created a system that bounces a laser beam off a wall to create an 'image' of objects hidden from view. The 'image' captured won't ..."
