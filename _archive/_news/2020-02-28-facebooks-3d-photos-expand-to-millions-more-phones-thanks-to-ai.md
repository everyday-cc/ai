    excerpt: "Thanks to AI, any photo can become a “moving” 3D image ... The company says it can make 3D pics out of everything from recent selfies to \"decades-old\" shots stored on your phone. Eventually, Facebook says it hopes to also apply the research to video, which could open up some interesting possibilities for its AR and VR efforts."
