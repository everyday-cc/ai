title: "Robots move interoperability to the forefront"
excerpt: "It was mostly coming from end users, like myself, who were seeing issues starting to happen in our facilities where our pallet-moving robots were not playing nicely with our mopping robots. Our concern was how we would be able to expand our fleets with other types of robots that had to operate in shared space."
