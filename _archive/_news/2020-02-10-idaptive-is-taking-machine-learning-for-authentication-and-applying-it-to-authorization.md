    excerpt: "This week, a team from the University of Liege in Belgium went old school. Using neuromodulation as inspiration, they designed a new deep learning model that explicitly adopts the mechanism to better learn adaptive behaviors. When challenged on a difficult navigational task, the team found that neuromodulation allowed the artificial neural net ..."
