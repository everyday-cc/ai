title: "Automate annotation of image training data with Amazon Rekognition"
excerpt: "Every machine learning (ML) model demands data to train it. If your model isn’t predicting Titanic survival or iris species, then acquiring a dataset might be one of the most time-consuming parts of your model-building process—second only to data cleaning. What data cleaning looks like varies from dataset"
