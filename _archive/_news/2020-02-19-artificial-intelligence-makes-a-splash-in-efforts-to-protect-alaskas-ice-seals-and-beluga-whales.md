title: "Artificial intelligence makes a splash in efforts to protect Alaska’s ice seals and beluga whales"
excerpt: "NOAA scientist Erin Moreland felt sure there was a technological solution to help her team sort through millions of aerial images of ice each year. She hit the jackpot with artificial intelligence. (Photo provided by NOAA) That better way is now here — an idea that began, unusually enough, with the view from Moreland’s Seattle office window ..."

  - title: "Machine learning is making NOAA’s efforts to save ice seals and belugas faster"
    excerpt: "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists are preparing to use machine learning (ML) to more easily monitor threatened ice seal populations in Alaska between April and May. Ice flows are critical to seal life cycles but are melting due to climate change — which has hit the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions hardest. So scientists ..."
