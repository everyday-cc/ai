title: "Researchers devise approach to reduce biases in computer vision data sets"
excerpt: "The researchers propose improvements to ImageNet, a database of more than 14 million images that has played a key role in advancing computer vision over the past decade. ImageNet, which includes images of objects and landscapes as well as people, serves as a source of training data for researchers creating machine learning algorithms that ..."

  - title: "Researchers Describe a Brainy Approach to Leverage Noise For Better Neural Networks"
    excerpt: "Those who design deep neural networks for artificial intelligence often find inspiration in the human brain. One of the brain’s more important characteristics is that it is a “noisy” system: not every neuron contains perfect information that gets carried across a synapse with perfect clarity. Sometimes partial or conflicting information ..."
