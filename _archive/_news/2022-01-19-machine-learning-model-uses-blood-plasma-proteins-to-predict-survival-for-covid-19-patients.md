title: "Machine learning model uses blood plasma proteins to predict survival for COVID-19 patients"
excerpt: "A single blood sample from a critically ill COVID-19 patient can be analyzed by a machine learning model which uses blood plasma proteins to predict survival, weeks before the outcome, according to a new study published this week in the open-access journal PLOS Digital Health by Florian Kurth and Markus Ralser of the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin,"

    excerpt: "A machine learning model could give greater insight into a patient’s ability to survive COVID-19. Researchers took from the Universitätsmedizin Berlin studied the levels of 321 proteins in blood samples taken at 349 timepoints from 50 critically ill COVID-19 patients being treated in two independent health care centers in Germany and Austria."
