title: "Speeding up TensorFlow, MXNet, and PyTorch inference with Amazon SageMaker Neo"
excerpt: "Various machine learning (ML) optimizations are possible at every stage of the flow during or after training. Model compiling is one optimization that creates a more efficient implementation of a trained model. In 2018, we launched Amazon SageMaker Neo to compile machine learning models for many frameworks"
