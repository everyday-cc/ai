title: "How far will Artificial Intelligence go?"
excerpt: "It’s not going to happen. Why should it? As Roger Schank notes in his article on “Artificial Intelligence” in the book, “This Idea Must Die”: “You’ll never have a friendly household robot with whom you can have deep, meaningful conversations.” We already have humans we can relate to who are far more complex than any computer."
