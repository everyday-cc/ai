title: "Using publicly available satellite imagery and deep learning to understand economic well-being in Africa"
excerpt: "It is generally difficult to scale derived estimates and understand the accuracy across locations for passively-collected data sources, such as mobile phones and satellite imagery. Here the authors show that their trained deep learning models are able to explain 70% of the variation in ground-measured village wealth in held-out countries,"
