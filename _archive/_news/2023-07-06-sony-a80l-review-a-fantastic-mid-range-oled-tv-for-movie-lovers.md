title: "Sony A80L review: a fantastic mid-range OLED TV for movie lovers"
excerpt: "The A80L’s pricing seems like solid value for a newly launched mid-range 65-inch TV. Particularly as it slightly undercuts the LG C3 in some territories. Considering that you might not need the expenditure of a soundbar (and we'd recommend one for the LG C3), that makes it a good option – even if it lags behind the C3 for some features."
