title: "Skidmore College Blocks Recognition of Progressive Zionists Club"
excerpt: "Skidmore College denied recognition of a progressive Zionists club on March 13. The Algemeiner reported that the club, Progressive Zionists for Peace (PZP), was told by Skidmore’s Club Affairs Committee that their application for a trial period was not accepted due to concerns “that a dialogue focused club with one perspective being conveyed could be troublesome” and that the club needs to “try to either gain more diverse perspectives before becoming a club focused on dialogue or reframe the mission to be more advocate focused with a specific stance."
