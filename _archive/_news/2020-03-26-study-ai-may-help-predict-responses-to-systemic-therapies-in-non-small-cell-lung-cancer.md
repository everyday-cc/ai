title: "Study: AI May Help Predict Responses to Systemic Therapies in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"
excerpt: "can predict tumor sensitivity to 3 systematic cancer therapies by using artificial intelligence (AI). Currently, radiologists can determine whether patients with NSCLC are responding to systemic therapy by quantifying changes in tumor size and the appearance of new tumor lesions. However, this type of evaluation can be limited, especially in ..."

    excerpt: "A blood test that uses machine learning to hunt for cancer DNA could reveal lung cancer in patients who otherwise would never have been tested. The system is accurate in roughly two-thirds of patients, but that may be enough to save an additional 1,200 lives per year, according to the scientists who developed it.

  - title: "Using machine learning to detect lung cancer DNA in blood"
    excerpt: "A large team of researchers affiliated with multiple institutions across the U.S. has found that it might be possible to use machine learning to detect early-stage lung cancer in human patients. In their paper published in the journal Nature, the group describes their work, which involved testing machine learning systems and their ability to ..."
