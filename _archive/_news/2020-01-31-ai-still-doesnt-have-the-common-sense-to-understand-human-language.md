title: "AI still doesn’t have the common sense to understand human language"
excerpt: "Until pretty recently, computers were hopeless at producing sentences that actually made sense. But the field of natural-language processing (NLP) has taken huge strides, and machines can now generate convincing passages with the push of a button. These advances have been driven by deep-learning techniques, which pick out statistical patterns ..."
