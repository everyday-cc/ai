title: "Driving triggers unexpected thoughts: Whit & Whimsey"
excerpt: "I was driving up Pearl Road last week when a sign caught my eye and I was astounded. Never, in 67 years of driving, did I ever expect to say, “Hey, gas is DOWN to $4.75.” Now that I think of it, I have more of those “I never thought I’d live to see” moments."
