title: "Stanford researchers propose AI that figures out how to use real-world objects – Jaweb"
excerpt: "One longstanding goal of AI research is to allow robots to meaningfully interact with real-world environments. In a recent paper, researchers at Stanford and Facebook took a step toward this by extracting information related to actions like pushing or pulling objects with movable parts and using it to train an AI model."

  - title: "Stanford researchers combine processors and memory on multiple hybrid chips to run AI on battery-powered smart devices"
    excerpt: "In traditional electronics, separate chips process and store data, wasting energy as they toss data back and forth over what engineers call a “memory wall.” New algorithms combine several energy-efficient hybrid chips to create the illusion of one mega–AI chip."
