    excerpt: "With Germany's acute labour shortage leaving few candidates to take on the skilled but dirty and hazardous manual work, the company will replace him with a robot. Other small and medium-sized companies are also turning to automation as the gradual exit from the workplace of Germany's post-war \"baby boom\" generation tightens the labour squeeze."
