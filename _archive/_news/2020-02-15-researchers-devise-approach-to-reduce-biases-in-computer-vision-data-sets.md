title: "Researchers devise approach to reduce biases in computer vision data sets"
excerpt: "The researchers propose improvements to ImageNet, a database of more than 14 million images that has played a key role in advancing computer vision over the past decade. Addressing problems of bias in artificial intelligence, computer scientists from Princeton and Stanford University have developed methods to obtain fairer data sets containing ..."

  - title: "Researchers Describe a Brainy Approach to Leverage Noise For Better Neural Networks"
    excerpt: "Those who design deep neural networks for artificial intelligence often find inspiration in the human brain. One of the brain’s more important characteristics is that it is a “noisy” system: not every neuron contains perfect information that gets carried across a synapse with perfect clarity. Sometimes partial or conflicting information ..."
