title: "Sama's wins and losses training AI in Africa"
excerpt: "Sama is a certified B Corporation and says it has lifted 65,000 people out of poverty since 2008 â€” but Gonzalez isn't offering jobs for life, and only around 10% of workers move from their entry level roles into product or management roles. The other side: Sama has faced persistent criticism and lawsuits over its labor practices."
