title: "Artificial Intelligence Can See Around Corners in Real Time"
excerpt: "Detailed, fast imaging of hidden objects could help self-driving cars detect hazards. Researchers have harnessed the power of a type of artificial intelligence known as deep learning to create a new laser-based system that can image around corners in real time. With further development, the system might let self-driving cars “look” around ..."

    excerpt: "Hiding behind a wall might not be practical for much longer thanks to new technology that uses artificial intelligence to see and even read around corners. A team of researchers from Princeton, Stanford, Rice and Southern Methodist universities devised a system that uses powerful lasers similar to a laser pointer. The beam is bounced off a ..."
