  - title: "Cracking the Code of Sound Recognition: Machine Learning Model Reveals How Our Brains Understand Communication Sounds"
    excerpt: "Researchers developed a machine learning model that mimics how the brains of social animals distinguish between sound categories, like mating, food or danger, and react accordingly. The algorithm helps explain how our brains recognize the meaning of communication sounds,"
