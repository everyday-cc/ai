title: "I tested Meta's Tom Brady and Kendall Jenner AI chatbots and it was weird"
excerpt: "Since Meta described his role as a \"Wisecracking sports debater who pulls no punches,\" I began the chat by chatting about the Jets' win last night. The first thing I noticed on the screen was the rectangle with Tom Brady's face in the upper right-hand corner, which resembled what you would see if you were on a FaceTime call with someone."
