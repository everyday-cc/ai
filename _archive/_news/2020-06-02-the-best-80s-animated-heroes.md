title: "The best '80s animated heroes"
excerpt: "This may sound lofty, but culturally speaking, this was a time of formative television, when Saturday morning cartoons would pave the way for entire channels of nothing but animated content. It was a time when many kids with shining eyes would form their ideals for a better world based off of the candy-colored heroes they saw on their television screens."
