title: "Why could your face be the ticket to fewer travel troubles on your next vacation?"
excerpt: "At some airports, cameras at the gate match your face to your passport photo already on file with the airline, meaning some international travelers do not have to present a ticket to board. Your face can also speed up the customs process with members of the global entry program allowed to upload a selfie to an app at certain airports to bypass the lines."
