title: "IBM uses AI to predict progress of Huntington's disease symptoms"
excerpt: "It could help with patient care and, hopefully, treatment. IBM is using its AI-based health prediction skills to help tackle the challenge of Huntington's disease. The tech firm has teamed up with CHDI Foundation on an artificial intelligence model that can predict when patients will experience Huntington's symptoms and, crucially, determine ..."
