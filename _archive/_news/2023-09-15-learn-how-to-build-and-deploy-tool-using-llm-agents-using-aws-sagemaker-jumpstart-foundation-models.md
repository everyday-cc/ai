title: "Learn how to build and deploy tool-using LLM agents using AWS SageMaker JumpStart Foundation Models"
excerpt: "Large language model (LLM) agents are programs that extend the capabilities of standalone LLMs with 1) access to external tools (APIs, functions, webhooks, plugins, and so on), and 2) the ability to plan and execute tasks in a self-directed fashion. Often, LLMs need to interact with other software, databases,"
