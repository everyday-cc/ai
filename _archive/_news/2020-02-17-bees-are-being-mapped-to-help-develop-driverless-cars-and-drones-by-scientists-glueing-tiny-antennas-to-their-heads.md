title: "Bees are being mapped to help develop driverless cars and drones by scientists glueing tiny antennas to their heads"
excerpt: "“So it makes sense to me that we should try and mimic a bee brain in drones and driverless cars. “It is just more practical than trying ... By reverse engineering the brains of honeybees they hope to design a new kind of artificial intelligence which is based on natural neural processes rather than machine learning."
