title: "Machine-learning structural and electronic properties of metal halide perovskites using a hierarchical convolutional neural network"
excerpt: "The development of statistical tools based on machine learning (ML) and deep networks is actively sought for materials design problems. While structure-property relationships can be accurately determined using quantum mechanical methods, these first-principles calculations are computationally demanding, limiting their use in screening a large ..."
