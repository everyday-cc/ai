title: "How Important Are The Early Phases of Neural Network Training"
excerpt: "The authors considered previous results where it has already been proven that iterating and rewinding the weights to their values early in the training of the unpruned model, rather than their initial values, led to better performance on deeper networks such as ResNets. In other words, this suggests that the changes in the network during this ..."
