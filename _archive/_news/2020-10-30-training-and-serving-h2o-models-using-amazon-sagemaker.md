title: "Training and serving H2O models using Amazon SageMaker"
excerpt: "Model training and serving steps are two essential pieces of a successful end-to-end machine learning (ML) pipeline. These two steps often require different software and hardware setups to provide the best mix for a production environment. Model training is optimized for a low-cost, feasible total run"
