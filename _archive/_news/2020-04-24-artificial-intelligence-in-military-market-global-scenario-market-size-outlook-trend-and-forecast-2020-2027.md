title: "Artificial Intelligence In Military Market Global Scenario, Market Size, Outlook, Trend and Forecast 2020-2027"
excerpt: "Artificial intelligence is not a weapon. Instead, artificial intelligence, from a military perspective, is an enabler, much like electricity and the combustion engine. The potential promise of AI--including its ability to improve the speed and accuracy of everything from logistics to battlefield planning and to help improve human decision-making--is driving militaries around the world to accelerate their research into and development of AI applications."
