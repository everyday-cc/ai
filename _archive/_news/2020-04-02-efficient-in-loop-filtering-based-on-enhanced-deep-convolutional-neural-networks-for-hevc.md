title: "Efficient In-Loop Filtering Based on Enhanced Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for HEVC"
excerpt: "To settle this problem, the in-loop filtering is used in HEVC to eliminate artifacts. Inspired by the success of deep learning, we propose an efficient in-loop filtering algorithm based on the enhanced deep convolutional neural networks (EDCNN) for significantly improving the performance of in-loop filtering in HEVC. Firstly, the problems of ..."
