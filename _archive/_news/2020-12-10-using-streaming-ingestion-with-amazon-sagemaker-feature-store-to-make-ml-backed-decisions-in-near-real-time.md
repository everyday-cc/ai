title: "Using streaming ingestion with Amazon SageMaker Feature Store to make ML-backed decisions in near-real time"
excerpt: "Businesses are increasingly using machine learning (ML) to make near-real time decisions, such as placing an ad, assigning a driver, recommending a product, or even dynamically pricing products and services. ML models make predictions given a set of input data known as features, and data scientists easily"
