title: "MIT researchers use artificial intelligence to identify powerful new antibiotic"
excerpt: "In brief: Researchers at MIT are harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to create powerful new drugs capable of killing disease-causing bacteria, some of which are resistant to all known types of antibiotics. Only a small number of new antibiotics have been developed over the past few decades due to the cost and time associated with ..."
