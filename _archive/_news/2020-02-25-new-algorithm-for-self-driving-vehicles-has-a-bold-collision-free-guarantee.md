title: "New algorithm for self-driving vehicles has a bold ‘collision-free guarantee’"
excerpt: "Researchers have developed an algorithm that could stop self-driving vehicles from getting in crashes and traffic jams. The team from Northwestern University (NU) claims their invention is “the first decentralized algorithm with a collision-free, deadlock-free guarantee.” The algorithm divides the ground beneath the machines into a grid."
