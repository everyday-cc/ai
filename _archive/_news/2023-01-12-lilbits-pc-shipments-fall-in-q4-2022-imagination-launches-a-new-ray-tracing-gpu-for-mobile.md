title: "Lilbits: PC shipments fall in Q4, 2022, Imagination launches a new ray-tracing GPU for mobile"
excerpt: "PC shipments in the fourth quarter of 2022 were down by 28.1% to 28.5% from the same period a year earlier. One part of the reason could be that many of the folks who were in the market for new computers already bought one in the past few years and donâ€™t have any reason to upgrade yet."
