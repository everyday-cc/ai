title: "Structure-based AI tool can predict wide range of very different reactions"
excerpt: "New software has been created that can predict a wide range of reaction outcomes but is also more flexible than other programs when it comes to dealing with completely different chemical problems. The machine-learning platform, which uses structure-based molecular representations instead of big reaction-based datasets, could find diverse ..."
