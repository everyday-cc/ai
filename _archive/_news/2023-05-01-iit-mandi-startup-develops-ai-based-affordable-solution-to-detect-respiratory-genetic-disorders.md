  - title: "Researchers develop a deep learning model to classify cancer cells by type"
    excerpt: "Cancer cells that initiate metastasis, or the spread of the disease from its primary location, are different from cancer cells that stay in the original tumor. Distinguishing metastasis-initiating cell types can determine the severity of cancer and help medical practitioners decide on a course of treatment."
