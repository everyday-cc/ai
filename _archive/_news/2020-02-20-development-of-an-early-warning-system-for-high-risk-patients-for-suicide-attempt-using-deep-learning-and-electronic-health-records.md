title: "Development of an early-warning system for high-risk patients for suicide attempt using deep learning and electronic health records"
excerpt: "Advanced machine-learning algorithms and deep neural networks were utilized to build models with the data from electronic health records (EHRs). A final risk score was calculated for each individual and calibrated to indicate the probability of a suicide ..."

  - title: "Building a Reverb Detection System using Machine Learning"
    excerpt: "Very little reverb. A lot of reverb. What we are actually trying to measure with our machine learning (ML) model is the Reverb Decay Time. This can be defined as the amount of time in seconds that it takes for a sound to fade away. The technical term for this is the RT-60 time, which is the time it takes for a soundâ€™s pressure level to drop ..."
