title: "Hidden fluid mechanics: Learning velocity and pressure fields from flow visualizations"
excerpt: "We address this problem by developing hidden fluid mechanics (HFM), a physics-informed deep learning framework capable of encoding the Navier-Stokes equations into the neural networks, while being agnostic to the geometry or the initial and boundary conditions. We demonstrate HFM for several physical and biomedical problems by extracting ..."
