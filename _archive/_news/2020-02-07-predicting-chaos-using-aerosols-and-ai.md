  - title: "How To Rise Above The ITOps Chaos Using AI"
    excerpt: "Data volumes generated by IT infrastructure are increasing two-to-three-fold every year. This combined with shrinking IT operations budgets is a clear recipe for disaster. Infusing AI into enterprise ITOps (known as AIOps) can help solve the above problem by identifying root causes near real-time."

    excerpt: "This kind of AI is first fed information about a real-world process, then, based on that data, it creates a simulation of that process. Motivated by game theory, a generative adversarial network receives both the ground truth (real) and randomly generated data (fake) and tries to determine which is real and which is fake. This process repeats ..."
