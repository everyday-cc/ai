title: "Learning to learn from data: Using deep adversarial learning to construct optimal statistical procedures"
excerpt: "We use tools from deep learning to develop a new approach, adversarial Monte Carlo meta-learning, for constructing optimal statistical procedures. Statistical problems are framed as two-player games in which Nature adversarially selects a distribution that makes it difficult for a statistician to answer the scientific question using data drawn ..."

  - title: "Deep learning for irregularly and regularly missing data reconstruction"
    excerpt: "Deep learning (DL) is a powerful tool for mining features from data, which can theoretically avoid assumptions (e.g., linear events) constraining conventional interpolation methods. Motivated by this and inspired by image-to-image translation, we applied DL to irregularly and regularly missing data reconstruction with the aim of transforming ..."

  - title: "Screening for chronic conditions with reproductive factors using a machine learning based approach"
    excerpt: "Therefore, in order to investigate their association, we applied a machine learning based dimensionality reduction technique, autoencoder, to generalize one single marker to represent chronic conditions. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Gansu Province of China. Random stratified sampling was adopted to include participants who were ..."
