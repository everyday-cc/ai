title: "Bills of the week: Robot bosses and STEM talent"
excerpt: "The bill is bipartisan â€” Sens. Dick Durbin and Mike Rounds are leading the charge. The legislation would exempt advanced STEM graduates of U.S. universities who have a job offer in the U.S. from numerical limitations for employment-based green cards. It would also protect their spouses and children."
