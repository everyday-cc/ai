title: "Google Proposes Scalable Parallelism for ML Computation on All Devices: Compilation Time Remains Constant As Devices Increase"
excerpt: "The structure of modern machine learning (ML) models can be defined as dataflow graphs between connected layers. Neural network training first computes the final output (forward pass), then computes the gradients of each layer weight (backward pass)."
