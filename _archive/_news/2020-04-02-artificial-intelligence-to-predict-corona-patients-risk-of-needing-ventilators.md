  - title: "Artificial intelligence to predict which COVID-19 patients need ventilators"
    excerpt: "Experts at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, have begun using artificial intelligence to create computer models that calculate the risk of a corona patient's needing intensive care or a ventilator. As coronavirus patients are hospitalized, it is difficult for doctors to predict which of them will require intensive care and a respirator."
