title: "Face it, Self-Driving Cars Still Haven't Earned their Stripes"
excerpt: "There's a huge problem in general with the whole approach of machine learning, which is that it relies on a training set and a test set, the test set being similar to the training set. Training is all the data that you've memorized, essentially, and the test set is what happens in the real world."

    excerpt: "1. Getting off southbound Shoreline east to Central Expressway north, midday, light traffic. On the blind downhill exit, I am shocked to suddenly see a row of stopped cars on the long “return” ramp, requiring emergency braking. A Waymo at the front won’t accelerate/merge with light expressway traffic, as a human driver would."
