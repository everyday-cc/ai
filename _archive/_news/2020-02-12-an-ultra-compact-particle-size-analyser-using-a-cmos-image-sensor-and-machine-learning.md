title: "An ultra-compact particle size analyser using a CMOS image sensor and machine learning"
excerpt: "In this paper, we introduce the concept of a new particle size analyser in a collimated beam configuration using a consumer electronic camera and machine learning. The key novelty is a small form factor angular spatial filter that allows for the collection of light scattered by the particles up to predefined discrete angles. The filter is ..."
