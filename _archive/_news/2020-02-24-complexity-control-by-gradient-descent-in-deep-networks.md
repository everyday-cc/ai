title: "Complexity control by gradient descent in deep networks"
excerpt: "Deep networks seem to avoid this basic constraint. In fact, more weights than data is the standard situation for deep-learning networks that typically fit the data and still show good predictive performance on new data 1. Of course, it has been known for some time that the key to good predictive performance is controlling the complexity of the ..."
