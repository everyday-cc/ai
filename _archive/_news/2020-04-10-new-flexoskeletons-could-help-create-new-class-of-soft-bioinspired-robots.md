title: "New Flexoskeletons Could Help Create New Class of Soft, Bioinspired Robots"
excerpt: "A group of these tiny robots could work as much as one huge robot on its own, or even more. In 1989, Rodney Brooks, cofounder iRobot who was then working at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, proposed space missions that would include “large numbers of mass-produced simple autonomous robots that are small by today’s standards.”"
