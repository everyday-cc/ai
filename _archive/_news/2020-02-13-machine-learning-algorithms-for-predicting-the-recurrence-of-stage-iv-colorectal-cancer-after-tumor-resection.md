title: "Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting the Recurrence of Stage IV Colorectal Cancer After Tumor Resection"
excerpt: "The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) technology to predict postoperative recurrence risk among stage IV colorectal cancer patients. Four basic ML algorithms were used for predictionâ€”logistic regression, decision tree, GradientBoosting and lightGBM. The research samples were randomly divided into a ..."
