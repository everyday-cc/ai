name: "AI in Payments & Fraud Risk Management Summit New York 2020"
excerpt: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is here for quite some time and is successfully being used in banking applications like Fraud Analysis and Customer Risk Scoring but with a limited scope. With such high expectations for the technology in payments and in myriad other industries, what will AI actually mean for consumers and merchants? What types of problems do payments technology companies and financial institutions expect to solve by deploying AI and other similar technologies? AI and machine learning is quickly becoming a valuable tool for payments companies and financial institutions to reduce fraud in all environments, but particularly in securing e-commerce transactions."
