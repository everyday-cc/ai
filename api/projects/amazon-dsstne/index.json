Models with weight matrices that are too large for a single GPU can still be trained on a single host. DSSTNE has been used at Amazon to generate personalized product recommendations for our customers at Amazon's scale. It is designed for production deployment of real-world applications which need to emphasize speed and scale over experimental flexibility.","sourceUrl":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/ai/api/projects/amazon-dsstne/index.json","webUrl":"https://everyday.cc/ai/project/amazon-dsstne/","originalUrl":null,"actions":null,"github":{"url":"https://github.com/amzn/amazon-dsstne","watches":350,"stars":4400,"forks":758,"languages":["C++","Cuda"]},"provider":{"name":"Amazon","domain":"amazon.com","images":[{"url":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/ai/assets/images/organizations/amazon.com-50x50.jpg","width":50,"height":50,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"publishers":null,"authors":null},"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":655,"tags":["Deep Learning"],"images":null,"content":"\r\n","name":"Amazon DSSTNE","type":"code","topics":["AI","AWS AI","Machine Learning"]}
