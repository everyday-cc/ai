      "excerpt": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is already being used to diagnose skin cancer, but it cannot (yet) keep pace with the complex decision-making of doctors in practice. An international research team led by Harald Kittler of MedUni Vienna has now explored a learning method in which greater accuracy in AI results can be achieved by incorporating human decision-making criteria.",
