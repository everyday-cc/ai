      "excerpt": "Even as a new benchmark in the space, MLPerf has been made available that runs representative workloads on devices and takes advantage of both common ML frameworks such as NNAPI as well as the respective chip libraries for each vendor. Using this benchmark on retail phones to date, Qualcomm has had the lead in almost all the tests, but given that the company is promoting a 4x increase in AI performance, it will be interesting to see if that comes across all of MLPerf’s testing scenarios. It should be noted that Apple’s CoreML is currently not supported, hence the lack of Apple numbers here. Across the board in these first four tests Qualcomm is making a sizeable lead, going above and beyond what the S888 can do. Here we’re seeing up to a 2.2x result, making an average +75% gain. It’s not quite the 4x that Qualcomm promoted in its materials, but there’s a sizeable gap with the other high-end silicon we’ve tested to date. The only non-lead is with the language processing, where Google’s Tensor SoC is almost 2x what the S8g1 scores. This test is based on a mobileBERT model, and either for software or architecture reasons, it fits a lot better into the Google chip than any other. As smartphones increase their ML capabilities, we might see some vendors optimizing for specific workloads over others, like Google has, or offering different accelerator blocks for different models. The ML space is also fast paced, so perhaps optimizing for one type of model might not be a great strategy long-term. We will see. In AI Benchmark 4, running in pure NNAPI mode, the Qualcomm S8g1 takes a comfortable lead. Andrei noted in previous reviews with this test that the power consumed during this test can be quite high, up to 14 W, and this is where some chips might be able to pull ahead an efficiency advantage. Unfortunately we didn’t record power at the same time as the test, but it would be good to monitor this in the future.",

      "excerpt": "Researchers at Fujitsu and the MIT Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM) have achieved a “major milestone” in the quest to bolster the accuracy of AI models tasked with image recognition. As described in a new paper presented at NeurIPS 2021, the collaborators have developed a method of computation that mirrors the human brain to enable AI that can recognize information that does not exist in its training data (also called out-of-distribution data, or ODD). Although AI is already used for image recognition in a range of contexts (e.g. the analysis of medical x-rays), the performance of current models is highly sensitive to the environment. The significance of AI capable of recognizing ODD is that accuracy is maintained in imperfect conditions - for example, when the perspective or light level differs from the images on which the model was trained. MIT and Fujitsu achieved this feat by dividing deep neural networks (DNNs) into modules, each of which is responsible for recognizing a different attribute, such as shape or color, which is similar to the way the human brain processes visual information. According to testing against the CLEVR-CoGenT benchmark, AI models using this technique are the most accurate seen to date when it comes to image recognition. “This achievement marks a major milestone for the future development of AI technology that could deliver a new tool for training models that can respond flexibly to different situations and recognize even unknown data that differs considerably from the original training data with high accuracy, and we look forward to the exciting real-world opportunities it opens up,” said Dr. Seishi Okamoto, Fellow at Fujitsu. Dr. Tomaso Poggio, a professor at MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, says computation principles inspired by neuroscience also have the potential to overcome issues such as database bias. “There is a significant gap between DNNs and humans when evaluated in out-of-distribution conditions, which severely compromises AI applications, especially in terms of their safety and fairness. The results obtained so far in this research program are a good step [towards addressing these kinds of issues],” he said. Going forward, Fujitsu and the CBMM say they will attempt to further refine their findings in an effort to develop AI models capable of making flexible judgements, with a view to putting them to work in fields such as manufacturing and medical care.",
