      "overview": "Buoy builds a free digital health tool that helps people â€“ from the moment they get sick â€“ start their health care on the right foot. Started by a team of doctors and computer scientists working at the Harvard Innovation Laboratory in Boston MA, Buoy was developed in direct response to the downward spiral weâ€™ve all faced when we attempt to self-diagnose our symptoms online. Buoy leverages artificial intelligence â€“ powered by advanced machine learning and proprietary granular data - to resemble an exchange you would have with your favorite doctor â€“ to provide consumers with a real-time, accurate analysis of their symptoms and help them easily and quickly embark on the right path to getting better.",
