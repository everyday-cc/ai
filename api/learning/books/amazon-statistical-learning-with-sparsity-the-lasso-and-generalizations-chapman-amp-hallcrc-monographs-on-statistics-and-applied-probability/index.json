Statistical Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations presents methods that exploit sparsity to help recover the underlying signal in a set of data.","sourceUrl":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/ai/api/learning/books/amazon-statistical-learning-with-sparsity-the-lasso-and-generalizations-chapman-amp-hallcrc-monographs-on-statistics-and-applied-probability/index.json","webUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Learning-Sparsity-Generalizations-Probability/dp/1498712169/","originalUrl":null,"featuredContent":null,"actions":null,"length":null,"ratings":{"count":11,"average":4.8},"provider":{"name":"Amazon","domain":"amazon.com","images":[{"url":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/ai/assets/images/organizations/amazon.com-50x50.jpg","width":50,"height":50,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"publishers":null,"authors":[{"path":"","title":"Trevor Hastie","excerpt":null,"sourceUrl":null,"webUrl":null,"originalUrl":null,"type":"profile","name":"Trevor Hastie","bio":null,"location":null,"website":null,"twitter":null,"linkedin":null,"googleScholar":null,"weibo":null,"youtube":null,"facebook":null,"instagram":null,"twitch":null,"wikipedia":null,"affiliation":null,"topics":null,"topItems":null,"size":null,"highlight":null,"heat":null,"tags":null,"images":null,"content":null}]},"publishedDateTime":null,"levels":["Intermediate"],"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":50,"tags":null,"images":[{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Q6p6XXw3L._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg","width":142,"height":218,"title":"Statistical Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations (Chapman & Hall/CRC Monographs on Statistics and Applied Probability)","attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"content":"","type":"book","price":"$83.05","topics":["AI","Math for AI","Machine Learning"]}
