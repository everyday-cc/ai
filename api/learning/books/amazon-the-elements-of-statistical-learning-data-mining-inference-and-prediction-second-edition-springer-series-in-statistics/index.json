While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of colour graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.","sourceUrl":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/ai/api/learning/books/amazon-the-elements-of-statistical-learning-data-mining-inference-and-prediction-second-edition-springer-series-in-statistics/index.json","webUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576/","originalUrl":null,"featuredContent":null,"actions":null,"length":null,"ratings":{"count":325,"average":4.2},"provider":{"name":"Amazon","domain":"amazon.com","images":[{"url":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/ai/assets/images/organizations/amazon.com-50x50.jpg","width":50,"height":50,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"publishers":null,"authors":[{"path":"","title":"Trevor Hastie","excerpt":null,"sourceUrl":null,"webUrl":null,"originalUrl":null,"type":"profile","name":"Trevor Hastie","bio":null,"location":null,"website":null,"twitter":null,"linkedin":null,"googleScholar":null,"weibo":null,"youtube":null,"facebook":null,"instagram":null,"twitch":null,"wikipedia":null,"affiliation":null,"topics":null,"topItems":null,"size":null,"highlight":null,"heat":null,"tags":null,"images":null,"content":null},{"path":"","title":"Robert Tibshirani","excerpt":null,"sourceUrl":null,"webUrl":null,"originalUrl":null,"type":"profile","name":"Robert Tibshirani","bio":null,"location":null,"website":null,"twitter":null,"linkedin":null,"googleScholar":null,"weibo":null,"youtube":null,"facebook":null,"instagram":null,"twitch":null,"wikipedia":null,"affiliation":null,"topics":null,"topItems":null,"size":null,"highlight":null,"heat":null,"tags":null,"images":null,"content":null},{"path":"","title":"Jerome Friedman","excerpt":null,"sourceUrl":null,"webUrl":null,"originalUrl":null,"type":"profile","name":"Jerome Friedman","bio":null,"location":null,"website":null,"twitter":null,"linkedin":null,"googleScholar":null,"weibo":null,"youtube":null,"facebook":null,"instagram":null,"twitch":null,"wikipedia":null,"affiliation":null,"topics":null,"topItems":null,"size":null,"highlight":null,"heat":null,"tags":null,"images":null,"content":null}]},"publishedDateTime":null,"levels":["Intermediate","Advanced"],"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":50,"tags":null,"images":[{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41aQrQaPseL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg","width":145,"height":218,"title":"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)","attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"content":"\r\n","type":"book","price":"$62.93","topics":["AI","Machine Learning","Math for AI"]}
