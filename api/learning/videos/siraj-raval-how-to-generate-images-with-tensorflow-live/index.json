We'll go through several examples including digit images and pokemon images. VAE's allow us to generate, compress, denoise, and even fuse images together. They are an incredibly powerful tool and we'll go over the implementation","sourceUrl":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/ai/api/learning/videos/siraj-raval-how-to-generate-images-with-tensorflow-live/index.json","webUrl":"https://everyday.cc/ai/learning/videos/siraj-raval-how-to-generate-images-with-tensorflow-live/","originalUrl":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=iz-TZOEKXzA","featuredContent":"<iframe width=\"800\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iz-TZOEKXzA\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","actions":null,"length":"PT1H2M51S","ratings":null,"provider":{"name":"Siraj Raval","domain":"youtube.com","images":null,"publishers":null,"authors":null},"publishedDateTime":"2017-05-10T03:24:38Z","levels":null,"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":50,"tags":null,"images":[{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iz-TZOEKXzA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":true}],"content":"","type":"video","price":"Free","topics":["AI","Machine Learning","Google AI","TensorFlow"]}
