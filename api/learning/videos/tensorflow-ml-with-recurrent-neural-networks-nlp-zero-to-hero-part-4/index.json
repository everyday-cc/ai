In the previous videos in this series you saw how to tokenize text, and use sequences of tokens to train a neural network. In the next videos we’ll look at how neural networks can generate text and even write poetry,","sourceUrl":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/ai/api/learning/videos/tensorflow-ml-with-recurrent-neural-networks-nlp-zero-to-hero-part-4/index.json","webUrl":"https://everyday.cc/ai/learning/videos/tensorflow-ml-with-recurrent-neural-networks-nlp-zero-to-hero-part-4/","originalUrl":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=OuYtk9Ymut4","featuredContent":"<iframe width=\"800\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OuYtk9Ymut4\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","actions":null,"length":"PT5M59S","ratings":null,"provider":{"name":"TensorFlow","domain":"tensorflow.org","images":[{"url":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/ai/assets/images/organizations/tensorflow.org-50x50.jpg","width":50,"height":50,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"publishers":null,"authors":null},"publishedDateTime":"2020-04-30T15:12:44-07:00","levels":null,"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":58,"tags":null,"images":[{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OuYtk9Ymut4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":true}],"content":"\r\n","type":"video","price":"Free","topics":["TensorFlow","Google AI","AI","Natural Language Processing","Machine Learning"]}
