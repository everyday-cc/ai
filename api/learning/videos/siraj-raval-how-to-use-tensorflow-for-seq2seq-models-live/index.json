You can use this model to make chatbots, language translators, text generators, and much more . We'll go over memory, attention, and some variants (like bidirectional layers) both programmatically and mathematically.","sourceUrl":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/ai/api/learning/videos/siraj-raval-how-to-use-tensorflow-for-seq2seq-models-live/index.json","webUrl":"https://everyday.cc/ai/learning/videos/siraj-raval-how-to-use-tensorflow-for-seq2seq-models-live/","originalUrl":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=ElmBrKyMXxs","featuredContent":"<iframe width=\"800\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ElmBrKyMXxs\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","actions":null,"length":"PT58M36S","ratings":null,"provider":{"name":"Siraj Raval","domain":"youtube.com","images":null,"publishers":null,"authors":null},"publishedDateTime":"2017-04-10T16:16:33-07:00","levels":null,"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":51,"tags":null,"images":[{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ElmBrKyMXxs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":true}],"content":"\r\n","type":"video","price":"Free","topics":["AI","Machine Learning","Google AI","TensorFlow"]}
