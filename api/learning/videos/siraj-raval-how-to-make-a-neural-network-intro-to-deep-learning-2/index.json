In this video, I'll discuss our brain's biological neural network, then we'll talk about how an artificial neural network works. We'll create our own single layer feedforward network in Python, demo it, and analyze the implications of our results. This is the 2nd weekly video in my intro","sourceUrl":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/ai/api/learning/videos/siraj-raval-how-to-make-a-neural-network-intro-to-deep-learning-2/index.json","webUrl":"https://everyday.cc/ai/learning/videos/siraj-raval-how-to-make-a-neural-network-intro-to-deep-learning-2/","originalUrl":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=p69khggr1Jo","featuredContent":"<iframe width=\"800\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p69khggr1Jo\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","actions":null,"length":"PT9M20S","ratings":null,"provider":{"name":"Siraj Raval","domain":"youtube.com","images":null,"publishers":null,"authors":null},"publishedDateTime":"2017-01-24T10:31:39-08:00","levels":null,"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":51,"tags":null,"images":[{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p69khggr1Jo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":true}],"content":"\r\n","type":"video","price":"Free","topics":["AI","Machine Learning"]}
