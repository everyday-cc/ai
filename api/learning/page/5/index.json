In Getting Started with Amazon Lex, you will be introduced to the skills required to leverage Amazon Lex to build these user interactions for the applications you create. First, you will learn how to define the intents that the ChatBot will fulfill for the user. Next, you will explore how to create the slots that will gather the required information from your user. Finally, you will discover how to implement Lambda functions that process the information gathered by your ChatBot to complete the desire of your users. When you are finished with this course, you will be prepared to create simple informational bots using Amazon Lex.",

Improve a network’s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images. You’ll teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems. Learn to process text, represent sentences as vectors, and input data to a neural network. You’ll even train an AI to create original poetry!",
