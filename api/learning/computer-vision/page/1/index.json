This course, Developing Applications with AWS Rekognition, will demonstrate how these features can be applied to your applications. First, you will cover topics like biometric access based on facial recognition and detection of unsafe content. Next, you will learn how to implement person tracking in security videos and metadata discovery for social media applications. Finally, you will see how other AWS services, like EC2 and Lambda, can work together with Rekognition to build complete applications. When you're finished with this course, you will be ready to use all of the features of Rekognition for image and video processing.",

We’ll develop basic methods for applications that include finding known models in images, depth recovery from stereo, camera calibration, image stabilization, automated alignment (e.g. panoramas), tracking, and action recognition. We focus less on the machine learning aspect of CV as that is really classification theory best learned in an ML course.",
