This course covers several ways machine learning can be included in data pipelines on Google Cloud Platform depending on the level of customization required. For little to no customization, this course covers AutoML. For more tailored machine learning capabilities, this course introduces AI Platform Notebooks and BigQuery Machine Learning. Also, this course covers how to productionalize machine learning solutions using Kubeflow. Learners will get hands-on experience building machine learning models on Google Cloud Platform using QwikLabs.","sourceUrl":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/ai/api/learning/courses/pluralsight-smart-analytics-machine-learning-and-ai-on-gcp/index.json","webUrl":"https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/smart-analytics-machine-learning-ai-gcp","originalUrl":null,"featuredContent":null,"actions":null,"length":"1h 40m","ratings":null,"provider":{"name":"Pluralsight","domain":"pluralsight.com","images":[{"url":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/ai/assets/images/organizations/pluralsight.com-50x50.jpg","width":50,"height":50,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"publishers":null,"authors":[{"path":"","title":"Google Cloud","excerpt":null,"sourceUrl":null,"webUrl":null,"originalUrl":null,"type":"profile","name":"Google Cloud","bio":null,"location":null,"website":null,"twitter":null,"linkedin":null,"googleScholar":null,"weibo":null,"youtube":null,"facebook":null,"instagram":null,"twitch":null,"wikipedia":null,"affiliation":null,"topics":null,"topItems":null,"size":null,"highlight":null,"heat":null,"tags":null,"images":null,"content":null}]},"publishedDateTime":null,"levels":["Beginner"],"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":50,"tags":null,"images":[{"url":"https://pluralsight.imgix.net/course-images/smart-analytics-machine-learning-ai-gcp-v1.png","width":1280,"height":720,"title":"Smart Analytics, Machine Learning, and AI on GCP","attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"content":"\r\n","type":"course","price":"$$","topics":["AI","Google AI"]}
