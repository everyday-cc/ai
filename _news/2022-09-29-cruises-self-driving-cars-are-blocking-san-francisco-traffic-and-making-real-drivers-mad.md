title: "Cruiseâ€™s Self-Driving Cars Are Blocking San Francisco Traffic And Making Real Drivers Mad"
excerpt: "Multiple Cruise autonomous cars have been spotted blocking traffic lanes in San Francisco and sending real drivers into a rage. Two of the self-driving Chevrolet Bolt robotaxis were seen parked up in the middle of the road near a busy intersection at Sacremento St and Leavenworth St with their hazard warning lights flashing and taking up too much space to allow other cars to get by."
