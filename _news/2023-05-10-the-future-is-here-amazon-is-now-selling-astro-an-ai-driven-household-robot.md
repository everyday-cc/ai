title: "The Future Is Here: Amazon Is Now Selling Astro, An AI Driven Household Robot"
excerpt: "Two years later, the vision for Astro is still strong, as the company has started selling the device as a part of its “Day 1 Editions” products—those which are accessible to buyers only through an exclusive invitation. Amazon typically reserves this category for its most cutting-edge technology, such as the Astro or the “Ring Always Home Cam.”"
