  - title: "Authors are resisting AI, but they have an advantage: Readers form relationships with writers"
    excerpt: "Some are suggesting AI will render the author disposable: publishers will be able to package and market any piece of AI-generated text. But the truth is the reverse. Author-centric promotional spaces, such as social media, writers' festivals, radio and television programs and other events, are integral to getting books into readers' hands."
