title: "AI Deep Learning Predicts Brain Tumor Growth"
excerpt: "Artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning combined with patient imaging data is opening a new world of possibilities for medical clinicians and researchers, especially in neuroscience. A new study published in the Journal of Theoretical Biology demonstrates how AI deep learning can predict brain tumor progression for glioblastoma from medical images to accelerate precision medicine."
