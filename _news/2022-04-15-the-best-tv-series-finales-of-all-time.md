title: "The Best TV Series Finales of All Time"
excerpt: "A reclusive billionaire invents a computer program able to predict future terrorist acts. The climax details the struggle to wrest control of the program from another program, the sinister Samaritan. In the end, good triumphs. The employees of Dunder Mifflin embark on new lives as many bid farewell to Scranton. And yes, Pam and Jim get married and move to Austin. Everyone has a happy ending. Cybersecurity engineer Elliot is recruited by an anarchist, Mr. Robot, to join a hacking group to erase all debt records held by a huge conglomerate. The two-part finale sees Eliot morphing between two alternate realities that may only be in his mind. In this Japanese anime series, an exiled Prince who has gained absolute power rebels against the Holy Britannian Empire. The finale depicts the final battle for Damocles. Wouldn’t think a show about a funeral home would be the basis for a comedy-drama, but “Six Feet Under” successfully navigated dark humor and drama. The show revolves around the extended Fisher family who owns the funeral home. In the end, the ultimate deaths of all the characters are portrayed."
