title: "US scientists create world’s first-ever living robots – and they’re now able to self-replicate"
excerpt: "US scientists created the first living robots, called xenobots. Now researchers have discovered a new form of biological reproduction – xenobots can self-replicate – in a way that is unlike anything seen in plants or animals,"
