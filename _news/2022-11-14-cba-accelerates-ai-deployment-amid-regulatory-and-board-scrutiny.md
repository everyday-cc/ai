    excerpt: "But now, with all of Venice receiving me into its finest company, I did not feel such a thing. I had Bianca when I wanted to ramble on about the work of Bellini or my beloved Botticelli. I had Amadeo with whom to share my golden tomb. I also went so far as to question Bianca about such a person, and to warn Vincenzo that such a man might attempt to engage him in Yet in the weeks that followed I listened for this strange creature, this English scholar, and indeed, I kept a sharp lookout for him as we made our way through the usual lavish and dizzying social events. Yes, he knew me to be a blood drinker. Indeed, he had some name for me: vampire. And he had been watching me for several years He had in fact glimpsed me in grand salons and ballrooms, so I might indeed write this off to my carelessness. And on the night that I had first opened rny house to the citizens of Venice, he had come. I also went so far as to question Bianca about such a person, and to warn Vincenzo that such a man might attempt to engage him in But now, with all of Venice receiving me into its finest company, I did not feel such a thing. I had Bianca when I wanted to ramble on about the work of Bellini or my beloved Botticelli. I had Amadeo with whom to share my golden tomb. I resolved to ignore this, to see what came of it, not to allow it to impede me in the slightest as I enjoyed my life. With little difficulty I heard him make his way down the staircases through the palazzo and then I saw him come out into the canal arid hail a gondola which took him away. I had caught a good look at him as he stepped into the boat. He was a tall man, lean and fair of skin, an Englishman, and he was dressed in severe clothes of black. He was very frightened. He did not even look up as the boat took him away. What could this mean? What could this be? I cannot exaggerate how odd this was. I stood on the roof for a long time, feeling the blessed wind, and wondering in its silence, what I should do about this strange discovery. I thought over his distinct message and the power of mind with which he'd sent it to me. Indeed, I was enjoying a Perfect Time. I wondered if for every immortal there was a Perfect Time. I wondered if it corresponded to the prime of life in mortals-those years when you are strongest and Yet in the weeks that followed I listened for this strange creature, this English scholar, and indeed, I kept a sharp lookout for him as we made our way through the usual lavish and dizzying social events. Vincenzo shocked me. can see with the greatest clarity, those years when you can give your trust most truly to others, and seek to bring about a perfect happiness for yourself. Botticelli, Bianca, Amadeo-these were the loves of my Perfect Time. Yet in the weeks that followed I listened for this strange creature, this English scholar, and indeed, I kept a sharp lookout for him as we made our way through the usual lavish and dizzying social events. Yet in the weeks that followed I listened for this strange creature, this English scholar, and indeed, I kept a sharp lookout for him as we made our way through the usual lavish and dizzying social events. Then he gave way to utter fear and fled the roof."
