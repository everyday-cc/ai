title: "How artificial intelligence can explain its decisions"
excerpt: "Today, when an algorithm identifies a tumor in a tissue sample, it doesn't reveal how it arrived at this result. And that does not inspire trust. Researchers are therefore pursuing a new approach."

  - title: "How artificial intelligence can explain its decisions"
    excerpt: "Artificial intelligence (AI) can be trained to recognize whether a tissue image contains a tumor. However, exactly how it makes its decision has remained a mystery until now. A team from the Research Center for Protein Diagnostics (PRODI) at Ruhr-Universität Bochum is developing a new approach that will render an AI's decision transparent and thus trustworthy."

  - title: "An Analysis of How AI Processes Its Information"
    excerpt: "To achieve this, they supplied the AI with a vast number of photos of microscopic tissues, some of which had tumors and others did not. Neural networks are initially a black box: it’s unclear which identifying features a network learns from the training data."
