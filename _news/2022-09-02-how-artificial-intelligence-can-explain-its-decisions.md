title: "How artificial intelligence can explain its decisions"
excerpt: "Today, when an algorithm identifies a tumour in a tissue sample, it doesn’t reveal how it arrived at this result. And that’s not very trustworthy. Researchers in Bochum are therefore pursuing a new approach."

  - title: "How artificial intelligence can explain its decisions"
    excerpt: "Artificial intelligence (AI) can be trained to recognize whether a tissue image contains a tumor. However, exactly how it makes its decision has remained a mystery until now. A team from the Research Center for Protein Diagnostics (PRODI) at Ruhr-Universität Bochum is developing a new approach that will render an AI's decision transparent and thus trustworthy."

    excerpt: "But thinking about AI in terms of a race for dominance misses the more fundamental ways in which AI is transforming global politics. AI will not transform the rivalry between powers so much as it will transform the rivals themselves."

  - title: "When — and Why — You Should Explain How Your AI Works"
    excerpt: "AI adds value by identifying patterns so complex that they can defy human understanding. That can create a problem: AI can be a black box, which often renders us unable to answer crucial questions about its operations."
