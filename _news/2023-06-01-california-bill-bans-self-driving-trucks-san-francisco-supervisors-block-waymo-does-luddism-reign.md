title: "California Bill Bans Self-Driving Trucks. San Francisco Supervisors Block Waymo. Does Luddism Reign?"
excerpt: "The California Assembly passed AB 316 by a vote of 54-3. Included in the bill is a provision requiring a human driver be present in autonomous trucks while testing, which was lobbied for by the Teamsters’ union. This is only an Assembly Bill: In order to become law it would need a Senate equivalent and the signature of the governor."
