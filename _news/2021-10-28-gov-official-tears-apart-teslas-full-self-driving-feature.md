title: "Gov Official Tears Apart Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” Feature"
excerpt: "It’s misleading.” Full Self-Driving is an optional $10,000 add-on to Tesla’s Autopilot suite. The feature has repeatedly come under scrutiny, especially once Tesla started testing a beta version of the software with the help of a small subset of drivers on public roads in October 2020."
