excerpt: "Gurman notes that the only reason why Apple hasn’t already rolled out Face ID for all of its products is a pricing issue and design limitations. But a “camera embedded in the screen would help differentiate Apple’s pricier devices by eliminating the notch at the top” could be how Apple pushes Face ID to all of its products."
