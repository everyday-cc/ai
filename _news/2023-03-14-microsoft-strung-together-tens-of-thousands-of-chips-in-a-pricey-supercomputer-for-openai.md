title: "Microsoft strung together tens of thousands of chips in a pricey supercomputer for OpenAI"
excerpt: "When Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019, it agreed to build a massive, cutting-edge supercomputer for the artificial intelligence research start-up. The only problem: Microsoft didn't have anything like what OpenAI needed and wasn't totally sure it could build something that big in its Azure cloud service without it breaking."
