title: "Machine learning brings sharpness and colour to thermal images"
excerpt: "A thermal imaging system that uses machine learning to disentangle the information contained in infrared images has been unveiled by researchers at Purdue University in the US. Dubbed HADAR, the system could allow passive thermal imagers to create images that appear as if they were taken in broad daylight â€“ according Zubin Jacob and colleagues."
