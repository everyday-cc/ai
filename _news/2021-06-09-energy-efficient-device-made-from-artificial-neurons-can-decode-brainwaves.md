title: "Energy-Efficient Device Made From Artificial Neurons Can Decode Brainwaves"
excerpt: "The electronic devices that current neural network algorithms rely on require an intense amount of processing power, meaning these artificial intelligence (AI) systems are still far from being on par with the human brain for processing sensory information or interactions with the environment in real time."
