  - title: "Christopher Nolan Compares Artificial Intelligence To The Atomic Bomb"
    excerpt: "After a screening of his new film, Oppenheimer Saturday night, director Christopher Nolan suggested that his period piece couldn't have come at a better time, as we're in an “Oppenheimer moment,” he said.
