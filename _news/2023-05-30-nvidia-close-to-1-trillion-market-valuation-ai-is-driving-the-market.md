  - title: "Nvidia Stock Soars on AI Chip Demand, Nears $1 Trillion Market Cap (NVDA)"
    excerpt: "Its outlook managed to bolster other chip companies, the broader stock market — and maybe the US dollar, too. Don’t forget the much tinier, $55 billion chip company Marvell Technology Inc. It enjoyed a 32% bump after projecting an AI-fueled doubling in sales. Rival Intel Corp. was decidedly not a winner."
