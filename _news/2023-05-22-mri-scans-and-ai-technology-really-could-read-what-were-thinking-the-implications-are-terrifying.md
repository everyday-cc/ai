title: "MRI scans and AI technology really could read what weâ€™re thinking. The implications are terrifying"
excerpt: "Future research may also speed up the training and decoding process. While it took 16 hours to train the machine to read what someone was thinking in the current version, this will significantly decrease in future updates. And as we have seen with other AI applications, the decoder is also likely to get more accurate over time."
