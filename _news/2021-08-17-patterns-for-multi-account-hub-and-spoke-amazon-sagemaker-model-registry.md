title: "Patterns for multi-account, hub-and-spoke Amazon SageMaker model registry"
excerpt: "Data science workflows have to pass multiple stages as they progress from the experimentation to production pipeline. A common approach involves separate accounts dedicated to different phases of the AI/ML workflow (experimentation, development, and production). In addition, issues related to data access"

    excerpt: "As customers continue to come up with new use-cases for machine learning, data gravity is as important as ever. Where latency and network connectivity is not an issue, generating data in one location (such as a manufacturing facility) and sending it to the cloud for inference is acceptable for some use-cases."
