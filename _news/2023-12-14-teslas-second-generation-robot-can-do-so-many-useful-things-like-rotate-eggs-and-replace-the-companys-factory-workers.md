title: "Tesla’s Second-Generation Robot Can Do So Many Useful Things Like Rotate Eggs and Replace the Company’s Factory Workers"
excerpt: "In the video Tesla released on Twitter Wednesday, Optimus 2.0 is a much more polished version, with a sleeker case, and even more ominous blank expressionless face. Tesla says the new bot is 30 per cent faster than the model it replaces, and it has lost 22 pounds, though most of the video focuses on the new bot’s increased hand dexterousness."
