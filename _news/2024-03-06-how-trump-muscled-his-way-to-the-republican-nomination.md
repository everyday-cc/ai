title: "How Trump Muscled His Way to the Republican Nomination"
excerpt: "Trump buzz-sawed his way through the Republican field thanks to an unusually solid foundation for a non-incumbent: he was an ex-president with universal name recognition, a celebrity reality TV star before that, the champion of an unshakeable base of loyalists and a capable fundraiser aided by a disciplined team that stayed on message."
