    excerpt: "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are about more than algorithms: The right hardware to turbocharge your AI and ML computations is key. To speed up job completion, AI and ML training clusters need high bandwidth and dependable transport with predictable low-tail latency (tail latency is the 1 or 2% of a job that trails the rest of responses)."
