title: "Reinforcement learning allows underwater robots to locate and track objects underwater"
excerpt: "A research team has shown for the first time that reinforcement learning—i.e., a neural network that learns the best action to perform at each moment based on a series of rewards—allows autonomous vehicles and underwater robots to locate and carefully track marine objects and animals."
