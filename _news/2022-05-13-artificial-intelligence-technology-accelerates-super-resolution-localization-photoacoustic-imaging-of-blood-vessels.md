title: "Artificial intelligence technology accelerates super-resolution localization photoacoustic imaging of blood vessels"
excerpt: "After a lightning strike, thunder can be heard for a short period of time. This is due to the fact that the surrounding material that was struck by lightning absorbs the light, and as a result of the conversion of this light into heat,"
