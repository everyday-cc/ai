    excerpt: "Instead, Tesla delivered Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta. The feature enables the vehicle to control itself through intersections, city streets, and highways. The vehicle virtually drives itself. However, Tesla doesn’t take responsibility for it. The driver is always responsible and has to be ready to take control at all times."
