title: "Brain dynamics uncovered using a machine-learning algorithm"
excerpt: "CEBRA is a machine-learning method that can be used to compress time series in a way that reveals otherwise hidden structures in the variability of the data. It excels at processing behavioural and neural data recorded simultaneously,"

  - title: "Machine-Learning Algorithm Predicts What Mice See From Brain Data"
    excerpt: "EPFL researchers have developed a novel machine learning algorithm called CEBRA, which can predict what mice see based on decoding their neural activity. The algorithm maps brain activity to specific frames and can predict unseen movie frames directly from brain signals alone after an initial training period."
