title: "Why their voice must be heard"
excerpt: "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians gathered at Uluru in May 2017 called for the establishment of a First Nations voice enshrined in the Constitution. This call from Indigenous Australia remains the contemporary response to the initial offer made by John Howard 10 years earlier to recognise Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in the Australian Constitution."
