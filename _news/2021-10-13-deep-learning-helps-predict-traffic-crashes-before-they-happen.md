title: "Deep learning helps predict traffic crashes before they happen"
excerpt: "A deep learning model predicts high-resolution automobile crash risk maps that describe the expected number of crashes and identify high-risk areas. The work was led by scientists from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Qatar Center for Artificial Intelligence."
