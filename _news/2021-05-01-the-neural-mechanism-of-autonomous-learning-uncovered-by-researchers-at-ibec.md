title: "The neural mechanism of autonomous learning uncovered by researchers at IBEC"
excerpt: "An international team led by SPECS Lab at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) reveals how the brain improves through self-supervised learning. Researchers also propose a novel brain-based solution to solve a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence: how machines could learn without direct supervision."
