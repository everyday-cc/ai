title: "Machine Learning at the Edge with AWS Outposts and Amazon SageMaker"
excerpt: "As customers continue to come up with new use-cases for machine learning, data gravity is as important as ever. Where latency and network connectivity is not an issue, generating data in one location (such as a manufacturing facility) and sending it to the cloud for inference is acceptable for some use-cases."
