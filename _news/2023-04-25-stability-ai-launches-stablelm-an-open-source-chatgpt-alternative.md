title: "Stability AI launches StableLM, an open source ChatGPT alternative"
excerpt: "Stability AI Ltd. is a London-based firm that has positioned itself as an open source rival to OpenAI, which, despite its \"open\" name, rarely releases open source models and keeps its neural network weights—the mass of numbers that defines the core functionality of an AI model—proprietary."
