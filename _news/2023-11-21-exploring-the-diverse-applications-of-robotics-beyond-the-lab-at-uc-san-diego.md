title: "Exploring the Diverse Applications of Robotics Beyond the Lab at UC San Diego"
excerpt: "For example, a team of robotics researchers at UC San Diego is developing a safety algorithm that can enable robots to navigate around pedestrians in crowded environments safely and efficiently. This algorithm, a blend of control theory and machine learning techniques, encodes implicit information about how humans interact and behave in crowds."
