title: "Googlers say Bard AI is “worse than useless,” ethics concerns were ignored"
excerpt: "From the outside, Google Bard looks like a rushed product to try to compete with ChatGPT, and some Google employees share those sentiments. A new report from Bloomberg interviews 18 current and former workers and came away with a pile of damning commentary and concerns about AI ethics teams that were \"disempowered and demoralized\" so Google could get Bard out the door."
