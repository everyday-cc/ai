title: "AF2Complex: Researchers leverage deep learning to predict physical interactions of protein complexes"
excerpt: "Proteins are the molecular machinery that makes life possible, and researchers have long been interested in a key trait of protein function: their three-dimensional structure. A new study by Georgia Tech and Oak Ridge National Laboratory details a computational tool able to predict the structure protein complexes â€“ and lends new insights into the biomolecular mechanisms of their function."
