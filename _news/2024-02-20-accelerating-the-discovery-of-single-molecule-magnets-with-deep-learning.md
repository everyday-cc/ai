  - title: "Accelerating the discovery of single-molecule magnets with deep learning"
    excerpt: "Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are exciting materials. In a recent breakthrough, researchers have used deep learning to predict SMMs from 20,000 metal complexes. The predictions were made solely based on the crystal structures of these metal complexes,"
