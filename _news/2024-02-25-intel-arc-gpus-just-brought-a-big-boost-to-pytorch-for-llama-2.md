title: "Intel Arc GPUs Just Brought A Big Boost To Pytorch For Llama 2"
excerpt: "Exactly such optimizations are available for Intel's hardware, both CPUs and GPUs, through the Intel Extension for PyTorch, or \"IPEX\". This package extends PyTorch with optimizations that specifically target Intel's compute hardware, including AVX-512 with VNNI and AMX on CPUs as well as the Xe architecture's Xe Matrix Extensions (XMX) units."
