    excerpt: "Boring AI is unlikely to break as easily and, most important, won’t kill anyone. Hopefully, soon we’ll forget we’re interacting with AI at all.

  - title: "Assessing AI readiness is paramount to execution"
    excerpt: "Without an AI readiness assessment, an organisation can end up doing proofs of concept and other initiatives without understanding why they’re failing. Assessing readiness, meanwhile, allows an organisation to identify any gaps in its capabilities and address them before implementing an AI strategy."
