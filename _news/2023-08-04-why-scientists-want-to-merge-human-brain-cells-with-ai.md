title: "Why scientists want to merge human brain cells with AI"
excerpt: "Some AI experts have called for a six-month moratorium on building such foundation models (which include LLMs), while others have even equated the risk of AI to that of a nuclear war. Others like Yann LeCun and Andrew Ng insist that AI is far from becoming sentient and that the benefits of AI far outweigh its perceived risks ."
