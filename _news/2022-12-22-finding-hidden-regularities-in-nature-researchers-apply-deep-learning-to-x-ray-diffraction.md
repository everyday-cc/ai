title: "Finding hidden regularities in nature: Researchers apply deep learning to X-ray diffraction"
excerpt: "X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an essential technique to identify the structures and compositions of newly developed materials. However, XRD patterns consist of multiple peaks, and it is not always possible to judge which ones are relevant to describe the features of the material."
