title: "DeepMind Explores the Connection Between Gradient-Based Meta-Learning and Convex Optimization"
excerpt: "Second nature for humans, meta-learning is a powerful yet challenging technique for AI systems that enables a model to meta-learn the parameters of a parameterized algorithm by self-evaluating its performance and adapting the learned parameterized algorithm to a given task."
