    excerpt: "O’Byrne and his team used artificial intelligence developed for the program to identify those who would benefit most. GetaKit.ca has since been expanded across Ontario. The program was so successful that Health Canada contacted O’Byrne earlier this year to ask whether the artificial intelligence and the program could be adapted to COVID-19 testing as part of a pilot program."
