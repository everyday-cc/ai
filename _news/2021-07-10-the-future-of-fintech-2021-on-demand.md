Among the topics on the agenda were: cyber security in the time of COVID-19, the RegTech solutions automating compliance, improving data literacy and governance, protecting customers from fraud, AI and machine learning, the rise of digital assets, upgrading legacy systems and ensuring data is safe and optimised in the cloud.
