title: "George Carlin’s heirs sue comedy podcast over “AI-generated” impression"
excerpt: "\"Defendants’ AI-generated 'George Carlin Special' is not a creative work,\" the lawsuit reads, in part. \"It is a piece of computer-generated click-bait which detracts from the value of Carlin’s comedic works and harms his reputation. It is a casual theft of a great American artist’s work.\""

  - title: "Did an AI write that hour-long “George Carlin” special? I’m not convinced."
    excerpt: "But I think that anger is at least partially misplaced. After spending the last few weeks diving down a distractingly deep rabbit hole, I’m convinced that Dudesy’s “AI-generated” George Carlin special was actually written by a human, using voice- and image-generation tools to essentially perform in “AI face” as part of an ongoing comedy bit."
