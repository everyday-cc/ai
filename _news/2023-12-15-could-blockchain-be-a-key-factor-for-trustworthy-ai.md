title: "Could Blockchain Be A Key Factor For Trustworthy AI?"
excerpt: "And this is where blockchain might prove useful. Using blockchain, we can create a cryptographic proof of a modelâ€™s inference. Inference essentially means the querying of a model. With so-called zero-knowledge proofs, we can confirm that an inference to a model has been made, how the model was prompted and which model was queried."
