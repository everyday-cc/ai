title: "Why is Modi getting global recognition and support?"
excerpt: "A year before the general elections in India, Prime Minister Modi is trying his best to get a third term by stabilising his home ground and strengthening his global credentials. A person who is still called the ‘Butcher of Gujarat’ because of his involvement as a Chief Minister of that state in augmenting Muslim carnage and communal riots of February 2002 has rehabilitated his international image."
