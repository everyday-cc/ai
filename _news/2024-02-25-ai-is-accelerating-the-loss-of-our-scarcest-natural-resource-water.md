title: "AI Is Accelerating the Loss of Our Scarcest Natural Resource: Water"
excerpt: "In some organisms, up to 90% of their body weight comes from water. Did you know that 60% of an adult human body is water. A baby is nearly 80%. Each day, we must consume water to survive. An adult adult male needs about 3 liters (3.2 quarts) per day while an adult female needs about 2.2 liters (2.3 quarts) per day."
