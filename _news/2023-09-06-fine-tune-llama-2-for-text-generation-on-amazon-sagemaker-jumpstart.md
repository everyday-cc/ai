title: "Fine-tune Llama 2 for text generation on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart"
excerpt: "Today, we are excited to announce the capability to fine-tune Llama 2 models by Meta using Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. The Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs) is a collection of pre-trained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Fine-tuned"

    excerpt: "In this post, we introduce a novel method to perform content moderation on image data with multi-modal pre-training and a large language model (LLM). With multi-modal pre-training, we can directly query the image content based on a set of questions of interest and the model will be able to answer these"
