title: "Artificial Intelligence Speeds the Search for Stable Proteins Used in Drug Development, Biofuels and Food Production"
excerpt: "Stabilizing proteins is a challenge for those doing research in drug creation, biofuel production and plastic recycling. The conventional approach uses trial and error – estimating which chemical compounds will stabilize proteins under different conditions – which can take months and is never guaranteed to work."
