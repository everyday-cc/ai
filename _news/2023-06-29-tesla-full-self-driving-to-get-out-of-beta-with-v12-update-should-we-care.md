title: "Tesla Full Self-Driving to get out of beta with v12 update – should we care?"
excerpt: "Now Musk said on Twitter that Tesla would get Full Self-Driving out of beta with the version 12 update. Tesla is currently on v11.4 of FSD Beta, but it could use every decimal before moving to v12. Over the years, Musk has so often claimed that Tesla was on the verge of achieving “full self-driving capability” that it is hard to believe him now."
