title: "Self-organization of neurons explained using a mathematical theory"
excerpt: "An international collaboration between researchers at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science (CBS) in Japan, the University of Tokyo, and University College London has demonstrated that self-organization of neurons as they \"learn\" follows a mathematical theory called the free energy principle."

  - title: "Free Energy Principle Predicts How Neurons Self Organize"
    excerpt: "The free energy principle states that this type of self-organization will follow a pattern that always minimizes the free energy in the system. To determine whether this principle is the guiding force behind neural network learning, the team used the real neural data to reverse engineer a predictive model based on it."
