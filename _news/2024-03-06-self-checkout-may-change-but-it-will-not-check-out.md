title: "Self-checkout may change, but it will not ‘check out’"
excerpt: "Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos took it a step further during the discount grocer’s recent financial earnings call. Vasos said the retailer was going to cut back on self-checkout, saying stores relied too much on it in 2023 and that self-checkout should be a secondary, not primary, checkout option."
