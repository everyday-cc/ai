title: "Prepare data for predicting credit risk using Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler and Amazon SageMaker Clarify"
excerpt: "For data scientists and machine learning (ML) developers, data preparation is one of the most challenging and time-consuming tasks of building ML solutions. In an often iterative and highly manual process, data must be sourced, analyzed, cleaned, and enriched before it can be used to train an ML model."

    excerpt: "Machine learning (ML) is realized in inference. The business problem you want your ML model to solve is the inferences or predictions that you want your model to generate. Deployment is the stage in which a model, after being trained, is ready to accept inference requests. In this post, we describe the"
