  - title: "How Machine Learning Aids New Mathematics Discoveries"
    excerpt: "Computers have long been used to aid mathematicians when it comes to solving long, complex and experimental equations. Additionally, machine learning and AI have also found application in disproving mathematical conjectures and theorems by being able to toil through vast fields of data and spot anomalies."
