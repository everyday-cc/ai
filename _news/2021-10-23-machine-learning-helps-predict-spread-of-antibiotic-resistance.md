  - title: "Machine learning approach effective in predicting antibiotic resistance spread"
    excerpt: "Genes aren't only inherited through birth. Bacteria have the ability to pass genes to each other, or pick them up from their environment, through a process called horizonal gene transfer, which is a major culprit in the spread of antibiotic resistance."
