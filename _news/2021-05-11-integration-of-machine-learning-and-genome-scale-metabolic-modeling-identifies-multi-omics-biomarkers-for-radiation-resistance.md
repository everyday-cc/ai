title: "Integration of machine learning and genome-scale metabolic modeling identifies multi-omics biomarkers for radiation resistance"
excerpt: "Personalized prediction of tumor radiosensitivity would facilitate development of precision medicine workflows for cancer treatment. Here, the authors integrate machine learning and genome-scale metabolic modeling approaches to identify multi-omics biomarkers predictive of radiation response."

  - title: "Systematic misestimation of machine learning performance in neuroimaging studies of depression"
    excerpt: "We currently observe a disconcerting phenomenon in machine learning studies in psychiatry: While we would expect larger samples to yield better results due to the availability of more data, larger machine learning studies consistently show much weaker performance than the numerous small-scale studies."
