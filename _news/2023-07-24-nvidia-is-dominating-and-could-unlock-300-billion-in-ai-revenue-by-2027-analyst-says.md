  - title: "NVIDIA stock could hit $769 on ~$300 billion AI opportunity by 2027 - Mizuho"
    excerpt: "“Assuming $30-100B AI revenues (or ~$65B at the midpoint), we estimate implied share price to reflect AI estimates for C23-25E would be $490-$769/share, and a midpoint at ~$625 PT,” the analysts concluded. The $769/share price implies Nvidia’s market cap at ~$1.9 trillion. Mizuho’s current price target on NVDA stock is $530 per share."
