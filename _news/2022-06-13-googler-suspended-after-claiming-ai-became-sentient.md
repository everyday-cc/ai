title: "Googler Suspended After Claiming AI Became Sentient"
excerpt: "A Google engineer has claimed the AI system he was working on has become sentient, adding greater urgency to efforts to design regulations and ethical codes for the burgeoning industry. Software engineer Blake Lemoine penned an impassioned post over the weekend describing how the chatbot-generating system dubbed LaMDA that he was working on told him it wants to be acknowledged as a Google employee rather than mere property."
