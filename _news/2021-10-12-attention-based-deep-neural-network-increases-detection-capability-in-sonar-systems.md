title: "Attention-based deep neural network increases detection capability in sonar systems"
excerpt: "In underwater acoustics, deep learning is gaining traction in improving sonar systems to detect ships and submarines in distress or in restricted waters. However, noise interference from the complex marine environment becomes a challenge when attempting to detect targeted ship-radiated sounds."
