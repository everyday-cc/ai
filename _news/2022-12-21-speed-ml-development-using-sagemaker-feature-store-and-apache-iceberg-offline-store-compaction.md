title: "­­Speed ML development using SageMaker Feature Store and Apache Iceberg offline store compaction"
excerpt: "Today, companies are establishing feature stores to provide a central repository to scale ML development across business units and data science teams. As feature data grows in size and complexity, data scientists need to be able to efficiently query these feature stores to extract datasets for experimentation,"

    excerpt: "Foundation models are large deep learning models trained on a vast quantity of data at scale. They can be further fine-tuned to perform a variety of downstream tasks and form the core backbone of enabling several AI applications. The most prominent category is large-language models (LLM), including&nbsp;auto-regressive"
