  - title: "AI tool can measure fat around the heart and calculate one’s diabetes risk"
    excerpt: "Accumulation of fat specifically around the heart has long been linked to cardiovascular and metabolic disease but until now there hasn’t been a simple way to measure this. A new artificial intelligence tool has been developed that can quantify these fat deposits from regular MRI images."
