title: "To evolve, AI must face its limitations"
excerpt: "And let’s face it: although not perfect, AI’s capabilities are pretty impressive. Even something as seemingly simple and routine as a Google search represents one of AI’s most successful examples, capable of searching vastly more information at a vastly greater rate than humanly possible and consistently providing results that are (at least most of the time) exactly what you were looking for."
