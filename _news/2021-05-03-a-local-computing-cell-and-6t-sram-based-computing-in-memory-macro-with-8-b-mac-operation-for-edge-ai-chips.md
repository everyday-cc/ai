title: "A Local Computing Cell and 6T SRAM-Based Computing-in-Memory Macro With 8-b MAC Operation for Edge AI Chips"
excerpt: "This article presents a computing-in-memory (CIM) structure aimed at improving the energy efficiency of edge devices running multi-bit multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. The proposed scheme includes a 6T SRAM-based CIM (SRAM-CIM) macro capable of: 1) weight-bitwise MAC (WbwMAC) operations to expand the sensing margin and improve the readout accuracy for high-precision MAC operations;"
