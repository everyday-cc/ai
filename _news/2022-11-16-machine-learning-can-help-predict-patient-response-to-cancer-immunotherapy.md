title: "Machine learning can help predict patient response to cancer immunotherapy"
excerpt: "It uses deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to recognize patterns in large volumes of data. In this case, the data is the amino acid sequences of proteins called T cell receptors (TCRs). TCRs sit on the exterior of the immune system’s T ..."
