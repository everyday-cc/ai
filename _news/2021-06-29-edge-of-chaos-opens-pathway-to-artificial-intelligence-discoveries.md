title: "'Edge of chaos' opens pathway to artificial intelligence discoveries"
excerpt: "Some neuroscience theories suggest the human brain operates best 'at the edge of chaos'. Now scientists have found that keeping a nanowire network at the edge of becoming chaotic is the best state for it to produce useful signals to solve problems."
