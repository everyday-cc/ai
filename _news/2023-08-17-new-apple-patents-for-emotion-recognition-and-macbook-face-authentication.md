  - title: "MacBook Face ID patent approved, but don’t hold your breath"
    excerpt: "One technical problem with implementing Face ID in the Mac is that there’s not necessarily a clear signal to trigger it. For an iPhone, it’s easy, as it can detect you picking up your phone, and then activate Face ID."
