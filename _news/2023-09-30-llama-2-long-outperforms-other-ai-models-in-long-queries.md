title: "Llama 2 Long outperforms other AI models in long queries"
excerpt: "However, Llama 2 Long has been trained on more data that contains longer texts and has been modified to handle longer sequences of information. This allows it to outperform other models such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 2, which have limitations on how much context they can use to generate responses."
