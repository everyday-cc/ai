title: "Musk open to price cuts as Tesla bets on self-driving future"
excerpt: "Wells Fargo analysts said FSD’s adoption could be impeded by its price, which Musk said was low. At $15,000 per car, the technology is about half the cost of the cheapest Tesla vehicle after a $7,500 federal tax credit. Musk, who on Wednesday called himself “the boy who cried FSD”, said “it is one of the hottest problems ever.”"
