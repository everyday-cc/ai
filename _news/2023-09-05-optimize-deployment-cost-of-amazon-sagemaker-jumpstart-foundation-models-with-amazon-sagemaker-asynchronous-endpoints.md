title: "Optimize deployment cost of Amazon SageMaker JumpStart foundation models with Amazon SageMaker asynchronous endpoints"
excerpt: "In this post, we target these situations and solve the problem of risking high costs by deploying large foundation models to Amazon SageMaker asynchronous endpoints from Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. This can help cut costs of the architecture, allowing the endpoint to run only when requests are in the"

    excerpt: "In this post, we introduce a novel method to perform content moderation on image data with multi-modal pre-training and a large language model (LLM). With multi-modal pre-training, we can directly query the image content based on a set of questions of interest and the model will be able to answer these"
