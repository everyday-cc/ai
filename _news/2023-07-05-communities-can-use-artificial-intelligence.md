  - title: "Valve says Steam games can’t use AI models trained on copyrighted works"
    excerpt: "Last week, we shared an anonymous report that Valve was blocking from Steam at least some games that make use of AI-generated artwork. Over the weekend, Valve confirmed that report, telling Ars in an e-mailed statement that the company is blocking games that use AI-generated content unless developers can prove those AI models were trained with data that does not \"infringe on existing copyrights."

  - title: "Generative AI in games will create a copyright crisis"
    excerpt: "As lame as this story is, it hints at a knotty copyright issue the games industry is only just beginning to unravel. I’ve created a story using my imagination—but to do that I’ve used an AI helper. So who wrote the tale?"

  - title: "Valve Does Not Want To Discourage The Use Of AI In Games"
    excerpt: "Banning AI art never really sounded like a Valve move in the first place. The libertarian company has long sought to place as few inhibitions on what can be sold on Steam as is possible, while steering wide of ever engaging with any political matter."
