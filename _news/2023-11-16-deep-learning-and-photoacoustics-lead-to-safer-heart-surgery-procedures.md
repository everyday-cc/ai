title: "Deep learning and photoacoustics lead to safer heart surgery procedures"
excerpt: "The researchers proposed using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to pinpoint the position of cardiac catheter tips in photoacoustic images. However, deep neural networks need to be trained on very large datasets to perform correctly, which would require hours of manual image acquisition and annotation."
