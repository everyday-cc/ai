title: "AI Model Detects Parkinson’s From Breathing Patterns"
excerpt: "A team of researchers at MIT has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model that can detect Parkinson’s from reading a person’s breathing patterns.  The neural network is able to assess a person’s nocturnal breathing,"

  - title: "AI Detects Parkinson’s Disease from Nocturnal Breathing"
    excerpt: "There are over 10 million people worldwide living with Parkinson’s disease (PD) according to the Parkinson’s Foundation. A new study published in Nature Medicine shows how artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning can detect Parkinson’s disease and monitor its progression from nocturnal breathing."
