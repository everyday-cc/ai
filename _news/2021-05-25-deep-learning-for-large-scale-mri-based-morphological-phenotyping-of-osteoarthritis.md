title: "Deep learning for large scale MRI-based morphological phenotyping of osteoarthritis"
excerpt: "Osteoarthritis (OA) develops through heterogenous pathophysiologic pathways, a primary reason there are not yet regulatory agency approved disease modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) to date 1, 2, 3. Several studies have recruited large numbers of participants and collected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate mechanisms of OA development and classify structural phenotypes 4,"
