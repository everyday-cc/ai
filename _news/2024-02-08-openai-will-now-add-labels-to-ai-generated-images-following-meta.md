excerpt: "OpenAI said that it would use a standard known as C2PA, a technical standard that allows content publishers to add metadata labels to content to verify its origins. Any image content generated by its generative AI DALL-E 3 or its ChatGPT AI chatbot, which uses the art generator, will now be labeled with this metadata."
