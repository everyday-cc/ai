    excerpt: "At the same time, generative AI text prompts in the beta now work in over 100 languages. You won't have to use a very common language like English to produce content. Generative Expand and the wider text prompt support should be available once you've updated the Photoshop beta app."

    excerpt: "Generative expand lets you use Photoshop's image-cropping tool to add new imagery beyond the borders of an image's original size. As with generative fill, Photoshop generates imagery based on a text prompt like \"forest\" or, if you don't type anything, just makes its best guess based on what's already in the image."
