title: "Can artificial intelligence help predict suicides?"
excerpt: "A study conducted in October 2022, led by the Black Dog Institute at the University of New South Wales, found artificial intelligence models outperformed clinical risk assessments. It surveyed 56 studies from 2002 to 2021 and found artificial intelligence correctly predicted 66% of people who would experience a suicide outcome and predicted 87% of people who would not."
