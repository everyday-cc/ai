  - title: "AI may predict the next virus to jump from animals to humans"
    excerpt: "Most emerging infectious diseases of humans (like COVID-19) are zoonoticâ€”caused by viruses originating from other animal species. Identifying high-risk viruses earlier can improve research and surveillance priorities."
