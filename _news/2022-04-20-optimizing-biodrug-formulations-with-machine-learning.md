title: "Optimizing Biodrug Formulations with Machine Learning"
excerpt: "A new algorithm provides formulation designers with the equivalent of a car accelerator to help them to reach the best formulation faster, and find solutions that would not be possible by intuition. The proof-of-concept of the algorithm was tested on single-chain antibody products but can be used for any formulation."
