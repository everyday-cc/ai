  - title: "Machine Learning Can Help Diagnose Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis from Other Conditions"
    excerpt: "A Mayo Clinic research study that appears in Mayo Clinic Proceedings highlights the potential for machine-learning algorithms to assist in clinical decision-making in cases of uncertainty. The inability to obtain a reliable history from patients with altered mental status or lack of access to imaging modalities may force providers to make a determination that is based on a limited amount of objective data."
