title: "Self-driving trucks from Googleâ€™s Waymo to deliver UPS freight from Dallas to Houston"
excerpt: "Autonomous driving company Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, will partner with UPS to conduct freight truck runs from a package facility in the Dallas area to one near Houston. Waymo Via Trucking first came to Texas in early 2020 but was only able to begin testing its Class 8 Freight trucks that August due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic."
