    excerpt: "Google DeepMind unveiled RT-2, the first vision-language-action (VLA) model for robot control, which effectively takes the robotics game several levels up. The system was trained on text data and images from the internet, much like the large language models behind AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bing are trained."
