title: "Face recognition technology follows a long analog history of surveillance and control based on identifying physical features- The Conversation"
excerpt: "Face recognition software is only the most recent manifestation of global systems of tracking and sorting. Precursors are rooted in the now-debunked belief that bodily features offer a unique index to character and identity. This pseudoscience was formalized in the late 18th century under the rubric of the ancient practice of physiognomy."
