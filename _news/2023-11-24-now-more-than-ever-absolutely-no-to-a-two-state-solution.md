title: "Now more than ever: Absolutely no to a two-state solution"
excerpt: "MIDA published Judith Bergman’s “Arab Historian Admits there is No Palestinian People” on Nov/09/2017. She wisely introduces her essay, “When the Ottoman rule ended, there was no Palestinian national identity or political borders. I was all made up later. Arabs themselves say so, but the west isn’t listening.”"
