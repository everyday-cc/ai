title: "This AI Stock Crushed the Market So Far This Year. Is It Still a Buy?"
excerpt: "Given the current state of Nvidia stock, investors should probably treat it as a hold. Indeed, both long- and short-term investors have earned massive gains from this stock. With its dominance in the AI chip industry, it will almost certainly play a critical role in the industry for years to come. That could take the stock higher over time."
