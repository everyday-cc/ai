title: "New DeepMind Framework Provides Fine-Grained Analysis of Distribution Shifts for ML Model Deployment"
excerpt: "When researchers create a new machine learning (ML) model, they seek to avoid the overfitting problem, where the model only performs well on data distributions similar to those in its training set. Instead,"

  - title: "DeepMind, Mila & Google Brain Enable Generalization Capabilities for Causal Graph Structure Induction"
    excerpt: "Discovering a systemâ€™s causal relationships and structure is a crucial yet challenging problem in scientific disciplines ranging from medicine and biology to economics. While researchers typically adopt the graphical formalism of causal Bayesian networks (CBNs) to induce a graph structure that best describes these relationships,"
