title: "AI threats: Can The Matrix and other sci-fi films teach us anything?"
excerpt: "In an apocalyptic warning this week, big-name researchers cited the plot of a major movie among a series of AI \"disaster scenarios\" they said could threaten humanity's existence. Two of the three so-called \"godfathers of AI\" are worried - though the third could not disagree more, saying such \"prophecies of doom\" are nonsense."
