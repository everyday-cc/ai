title: "Detect defects and augment predictions using Amazon Lookout for Vision and Amazon A2I"
excerpt: "With machine learning (ML), more powerful technologies have become available that can automate the task of detecting visual anomalies in a product. However, implementing such ML solutions is time-consuming and expensive because it involves managing and setting up complex infrastructure and having the"

  - title: "Automate annotation of image training data with Amazon Rekognition"
    excerpt: "Every machine learning (ML) model demands data to train it. If your model isn’t predicting Titanic survival or iris species, then acquiring a dataset might be one of the most time-consuming parts of your model-building process—second only to data cleaning. What data cleaning looks like varies from dataset"

  - title: "Simplify data annotation and model training tasks with Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels"
    excerpt: "For a supervised machine learning (ML) problem, labels are values expected to be learned and predicted by a model. To obtain accurate labels, ML practitioners can either record them in real time or conduct offline data annotation, which are activities that assign labels to the dataset based on human"
