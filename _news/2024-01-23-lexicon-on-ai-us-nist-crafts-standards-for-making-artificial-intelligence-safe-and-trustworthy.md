title: "Lexicon on AI: US NIST crafts standards for making artificial intelligence safe and trustworthy"
excerpt: "Q: The AI risk framework was voluntary but the executive order mandates some obligations for developers. That includes submitting large-language models for government red-teaming (testing for risks and vulnerabilities) once they reach a certain threshold in size and computing power. Will NIST be in charge of determining which models get red-teamed?"
