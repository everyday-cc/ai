  - title: "Lighting up artificial neural networks"
    excerpt: "A team of international scientists have performed machine learning computations using a nano-scale device, named an “optomemristor”. The chalcogenide thin-film device uses both light and electrical systems to interact and emulate the biological computations of the mammalian brain using multi-factor interactions while consuming very little energy."
