title: "A person-shaped robot that can liquify and escape jail, all with the power of magnets"
excerpt: "Inspired by sea cucumbers, engineers have designed miniature robots that rapidly and reversibly shift between liquid and solid states. On top of being able to shape-shift, the robots are magnetic and can conduct electricity."
