title: "AI models are powerful, but are they biologically plausible?"
excerpt: "Artificial neural networks, ubiquitous machine-learning models that can be trained to complete many tasks, are so called because their architecture is inspired by the way biological neurons process information in the human brain."

  - title: "AI models are powerful, but are they biologically plausible?"
    excerpt: "Researchers hypothesize that a powerful type of AI model known as a transformer could be implemented in the brain through networks of neuron and astrocyte cells. The work could offer insights into how the brain works and help scientists understand why transformers are so effective at machine-learning tasks."
