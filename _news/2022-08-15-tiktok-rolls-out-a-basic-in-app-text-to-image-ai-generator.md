    excerpt: "You don't need to fire up DALL-E if you want AI to create images from text — you just need a popular social media app. The Verge notes TikTok has introduced a rudimentary \"AI greenscreen\" effect in its Android and iOS apps that turns your text descriptions into artwork."

    excerpt: "The output of TikTok’s system is pretty basic compared to that of state-of-the-art text-to-image models like Google’s Imagen, OpenAI’s DALL-E 2, or Midjourney’s eponymous software. It creates only rather abstract and swirling images;"
