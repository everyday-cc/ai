title: "Identification and control of a DC motor using back-propagation neural networks"
excerpt: "An artificial-neural-network (ANN)-based high-performance speed-control system for a DC motor is introduced. The rotor speed of the DC motor can be made to follow an arbitrarily selected trajectory. The purpose is to achieve accurate trajectory control of the speed,"
