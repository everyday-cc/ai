    excerpt: "Elon Musk said self-driving cars that could drive \"anywhere\" would be here within two or three years. In 2016, Lyft CEO John Zimmer predicted they would \"all but end\" car ownership by 2025. In 2018, Waymo CEO John Krafcik warned autonomous robocars would take longer than expected."
