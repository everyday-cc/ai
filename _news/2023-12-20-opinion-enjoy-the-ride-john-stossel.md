title: "Opinion: Enjoy the Ride â€“ John Stossel"
excerpt: "The magic of the driverless vehicle is the artificial intelligence behind the sensors. That allows the cars to operate like a human nervous system. Sensors and radar are the eyes and ears. The brain is algorithms trained by billions of simulated trips. The more the robo-cars drive, the more they learn, and the smarter and safer they get."
