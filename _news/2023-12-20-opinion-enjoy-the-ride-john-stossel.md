title: "Opinion: Enjoy the Ride – John Stossel"
excerpt: "The magic of the driverless vehicle is the artificial intelligence behind the sensors. That allows the cars to operate like a human nervous system. Sensors and radar are the eyes and ears. The brain is algorithms trained by billions of simulated trips. The more the robo-cars drive, the more they learn, and the smarter and safer they get."

    excerpt: "Still, many Americans object to robo-cars. Unions complain that they will take away taxi driver jobs, delivery jobs and especially truck-driving jobs. They are right, but in the long run, that will actually be (SET ITAL)good (END ITAL) for most workers. I'll make that argument in a future column."
