title: "Chain custom Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth jobs for image processing"
excerpt: "Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth supports many different types of labeling jobs, including several image-based labeling workflows like image-level labels, bounding box-specific labels, or pixel-level labeling. For situations not covered by these standard approaches, Ground Truth also supports custom image-based"
