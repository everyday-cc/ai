title: "That ad you see? It may have come from a robot, kind of."
excerpt: "The ad business may evoke images of “Mad Men,” the hit show depicting boozy, smoke-filled brainstorming sessions between admen and clients looking to sell their products in the 1960s. Today’s admen — and women — probably substitute Red Bull and artisanal coffee for the booze and cigarettes. And there’s still plenty of brainstorming."
