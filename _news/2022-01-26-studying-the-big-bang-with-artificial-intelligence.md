title: "Studying the Big Bang With Artificial Intelligence"
excerpt: "Immediately after the Big Bang, the entire universe was in this state; today it is produced by high-energy atomic nucleus collisions, for example at CERN. Such processes can only be studied using high-performance computers and highly complex computer simulations whose results are difficult to evaluate."

  - title: "Getting AI from the lab to production"
    excerpt: "The enterprise is eager to push AI out of the lab and into production environments, where it will hopefully usher in a new era of productivity and profitability. But this is not as easy as it seems because it turns out that AI tends to behave much differently in the test bed than it does in the real world."
