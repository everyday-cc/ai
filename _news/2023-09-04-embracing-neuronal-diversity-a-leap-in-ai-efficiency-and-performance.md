  - title: "An 'introspective' AI finds diversity improves performance"
    excerpt: "An artificial intelligence with the ability to look inward and fine tune its own neural network performs better when it chooses diversity over lack of diversity, a new study finds. The resulting diverse neural networks were particularly effective at solving complex tasks."
