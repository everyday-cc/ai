title: "Optimize your inference jobs using dynamic batch inference with TorchServe on Amazon SageMaker"
excerpt: "In deep learning, batch processing refers to feeding multiple inputs into a model. Although itâ€™s essential during training, it can be very helpful to manage the cost and optimize throughput during inference time as well. Hardware accelerators are optimized for parallelism, and batching helps saturate"
