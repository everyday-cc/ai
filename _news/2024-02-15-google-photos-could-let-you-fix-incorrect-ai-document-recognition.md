title: "Google Photos could let you fix incorrect AI document recognition"
excerpt: "Google Photos categorizes images of documents automatically, but sometimes it misidentifies them, hamstringing the user experience. A feature in development will allow users to manually recategorize images in the Documents section of Google Photos. Manual correction could contribute to improving Google's automatic categorization system too."

    excerpt: "As spotted by 9to5Google in an APK teardown, it appears that Google is testing out an option that would allow users to double-tap to react in the Messages app. This is based on code seen in the beta version of the app, but it has not been confirmed by the company, nor has it been officially rolled out on the stable or beta channel."
