  - title: "Analogue deep learning offers faster computation for artificial intelligence with much less energy"
    excerpt: "A multidisciplinary team of MIT researchers set out to push the speed limits of a type of human-made analogue synapse that they had previously developed. They utilized a practical inorganic material in the fabrication process that enables their devices to run 1 million times faster than previous versions,"
