  - title: "AI proves a dab hand at pure mathematics and protein hallucination"
    excerpt: "One of the reasons artificial intelligence is such an interesting field is that pretty much no one knows what it might turn out to be good at. Two papers by leading labs published in the journal Nature today show that machine learning can be applied to tasks as technically demanding as protein"

  - title: "Mathematical discoveries take intuition and creativity – and now a little help from AI"
    excerpt: "To find the answers, mathematicians like me try to find patterns that relate complicated mathematical objects by making conjectures (ideas about how those patterns might work), which are promoted to theorems if we can prove they are true."
