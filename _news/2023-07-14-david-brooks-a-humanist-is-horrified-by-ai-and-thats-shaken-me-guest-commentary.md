title: "David Brooks: A humanist is horrified by AI, and that’s shaken me. | GUEST COMMENTARY"
excerpt: "Recently I stumbled across an essay by Douglas Hofstadter that made me happy. Hofstadter is an eminent cognitive scientist and the author of books like “Gödel, Escher, Bach” and “I Am a Strange Loop.” The essay that pleased me so much, called “The Shallowness of Google Translate,” was published in The Atlantic in January of 2018."
