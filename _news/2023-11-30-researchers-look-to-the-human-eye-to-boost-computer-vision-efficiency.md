title: "Researchers look to the human eye to boost computer vision efficiency"
excerpt: "“In a normal computer vision system, you create a signal, then you have to transfer the data from memory to processing and back to memory; it takes a lot of time and energy to do that,” Chen said. “Our device has integrated functions of light perception, light to electric signal transformation, and on-site memory and data processing.”"
