title: "Is Paytm building an AGI software stack? or is it AGI-washing?"
excerpt: "He added that by building this stack in India, Patym is not only making it \"our countryâ€™s tech capability\" but also \"creating something that could be leveraged outside India\". In May, too, he had spoken about how the \"advent of early-stage AGI in 2023\" would help him make Paytm's business more efficient."
