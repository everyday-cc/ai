title: "AI Is Rewriting the Rules of $200 Billion Games Industry"
excerpt: "“AI is the game changer I've been waiting for,” 48-year-old Hanazawa said. By freeing developers from the burden of mass-producing graphics, it promises to revitalize the entire industry. “Publishers will be able to take more risks, creators can become creative again, and users as a result can choose from a much wider variety of games.”"

  - title: "Authors are resisting AI, but they have an advantage: Readers form relationships with writers"
    excerpt: "Some are suggesting AI will render the author disposable: publishers will be able to package and market any piece of AI-generated text. But the truth is the reverse. Author-centric promotional spaces, such as social media, writers' festivals, radio and television programs and other events, are integral to getting books into readers' hands."
