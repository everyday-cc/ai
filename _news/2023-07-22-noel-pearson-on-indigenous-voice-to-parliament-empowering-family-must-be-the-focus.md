title: "Noel Pearson on Indigenous voice to parliament: ‘Empowering family must be the focus’"
excerpt: "Pearson has been at the forefront of the push for constitutional recognition since 2007, when prime minister John Howard first pledged support for a referendum on the issue. Asked why it has taken so long to come to fruition, Pearson replies: “Because it’s a blackfella issue. It’s hard to get a blackfella issue up.”"
