title: "Humans the risk of artificial intelligence"
excerpt: "The risk of AI is not AI, but the human, and the carnage left in the wake of our ideological attachments. As much as we may assume our expertise and ability to use, misuse, guide or control the remarkable tools that we have created, we will continue to stumble towards our demise as long as the awareness remains external to the human experience."

  - title: "3 ways to play the artificial intelligence boom"
    excerpt: "Stocks related to artificial intelligence (AI) have been leading the market higher this year, with names such as Microsoft, Nvidia and Apple jumping between 33% and 218% year to date. These gains are reminiscent of the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s. I’m not entirely convinced we’re in a similar position, but we are certainly in a peculiar market."
