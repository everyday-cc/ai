  - title: "Self-driving cars can make traffic slower"
    excerpt: "A new study finds that 'connected' vehicles, which share data with each other wirelessly, significantly improve travel time through intersections -- but automated vehicles can actually slow down travel time through intersections if they are not connected to each other."
