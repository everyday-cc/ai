title: "Using Artificial Intelligence to Identify Fractures on X-rays"
excerpt: "According to a study by Boston University School of Medicine researchers, artificial intelligence can assist clinicians in detecting fractures on x-rays. â€œOur AI algorithm can quickly and automatically detect x-rays that are positive for fractures and flag those studies in the system so that radiologists can prioritize reading x-rays with positive fractures,"

  - title: "Study finds artificial intelligence accurately detects fractures on X-rays"
    excerpt: "Emergency room and urgent care clinics are typically busy and patients often have to wait many hours before they can be seen, evaluated and receive treatment. Waiting for X-rays to be interpreted by radiologists can contribute to this long wait time because radiologists often read X-rays for a large number of patients."
