title: "Cathie Wood Warns About a Hard Landing for the Economy, but Thinks Artificial Intelligence (AI) Could Come to the Rescue"
excerpt: "Wood predicts that autonomous ride-hailing powered by AI (often referred to as robotaxis) presents the greatest growth opportunity for Tesla. Her bear case for the stock is to soar by more than 5.5x by 2027. Roughly two-thirds of Wood's projected valuation for Tesla is tied to the robotaxi market."
