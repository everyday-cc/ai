    excerpt: "Waymo One, a driverless taxi service, will be available to the public in locations across the L.A. area, starting with Santa Monica on Oct. 11. Why it matters: You can hail Waymo's driverless cars in places like Phoenix, San Francisco, and now L.A. However, the cars have been a source of controversy for sometimes stalling in the middle of the road."
