    excerpt: "One of the UK’s most ambitious robotics projects has proven the concept for robotic teams repairing offshore wind farms. The project paves the way for human-robot teams at wind farms within 10 years and wind farms designed for robotic maintenance by 2050 – a scenario that will be vital to the UK achieving its Net Zero targets."
