  - title: "\"Protonic\" artificial synapse runs a million times faster than human ones"
    excerpt: "Engineers at MIT have developed a new type of artificial synapse that’s extremely energy ... rather than transferring it between different components. Neural networks make use of this principle, but they have their own hardware limitations."
