title: "Mathematical theory predicts self-organized learning in real neurons"
excerpt: "Researchers have demonstrated that self-organization of neurons as they 'learn' follows a mathematical theory called the free energy principle. The principle accurately predicted how real neural networks spontaneously reorganize during learning,"

  - title: "Free Energy Principle Predicts How Neurons Self Organize"
    excerpt: "The free energy principle states that this type of self-organization will follow a pattern that always minimizes the free energy in the system. To determine whether this principle is the guiding force behind neural network learning, the team used the real neural data to reverse engineer a predictive model based on it."
