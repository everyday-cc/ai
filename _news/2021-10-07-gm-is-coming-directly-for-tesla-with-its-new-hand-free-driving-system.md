title: "GM is coming directly for Tesla with its new hand-free driving system"
excerpt: "The prior driver-assist system, Super Cruise, has won yearly accolades from reviewers like Consumer Reports, who consistently preferred it over Tesla’s Full-Self Driving system. That’s mainly down to GM’s system having a camera trained on the driver at all times to monitor how much attention they’re paying to the road."
