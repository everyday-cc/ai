title: "On cusp of Joe Biden speech, a state of disunity, funk and peril"
excerpt: "In their State of the Union speeches, they declare “the state of our union is strong,” or words very much like it.

    excerpt: "Biden will step up to the House speaker's rostrum to address a nation in conflict with itself. The country is litigating how to keep kids safe and what to teach them, and suddenly plenty worried about Russian expansionism."
