  - title: "Mind-controlling robotic arm from distance? Scientists restore sense of touch through this unique innovation"
    excerpt: "Imagine being able to control a robotic arm from a distance, using only your mind. Now imagine being able to feel when its fingers grasp an object, as though it were your own hand. US researchers published a study in the journalÂ Science about the world's first brain-computer interface that allowed a volunteer with paralysis from the chest down to accomplish this very feat."
