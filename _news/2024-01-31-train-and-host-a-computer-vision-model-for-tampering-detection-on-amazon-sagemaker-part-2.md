title: "Train and host a computer vision model for tampering detection on Amazon SageMaker: Part 2"
excerpt: "In the first part of this three-part series, we presented a solution that demonstrates how you can automate detecting document tampering and fraud at scale using AWS AI and machine learning (ML) services for a mortgage underwriting use case. In this post, we present an approach to develop a deep learning-based"

    excerpt: "When deploying a large language model (LLM), machine learning (ML) practitioners typically care about two measurements for model serving performance: latency, defined by the time it takes to generate a single token, and throughput, defined by the number of tokens generated per second. Although a single"

    excerpt: "With the advent of generative AI, today’s foundation models (FMs), such as the large language models (LLMs) Claude 2 and Llama 2, can perform a range of generative tasks such as question answering, summarization, and content creation on text data. However, real-world data exists in multiple modalities,"
