title: "Weapon of mass distraction - how much damage might AI have on democracy as 2024's election frenzy looms?"
excerpt: "The Times recently reported the existence of deep-fake videos of Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the UK's Labour Party, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan espousing extreme or offensive views. It also noted that it is easy for bad actors to use AI tools to create fake videos of, say, statues being toppled or large boats of migrants heading for the UK."
