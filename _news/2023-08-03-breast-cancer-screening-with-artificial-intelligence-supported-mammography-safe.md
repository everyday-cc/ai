  - title: "AI-supported screenings increase breast cancer detection by 20%, study says"
    excerpt: "The group whose scans were assisted by AI found 20% more cancers than the group without AI assistance. However, this doesn’t mean hospitals will let a computer determine whether a patient has cancer any time soon. The authors of the study say there is still a lot more research to do."

  - title: "AI shows its value in mammography screening"
    excerpt: "A study has shown that artificial intelligence can be safely used to support mammography to spot breast cancers and may spot more tumours than the current standard approach.
