title: "The huge power and potential danger of AI-generated code"
excerpt: "Late last year, a team at Stanford University posted a research paper that looked at how using a code-generating AI assistant they built affects the quality of code that people produce. The researchers found that programmers getting AI suggestions tended to include more bugs in their final codeâ€”yet those with access to the tool tended to believe that their code was more secure."
