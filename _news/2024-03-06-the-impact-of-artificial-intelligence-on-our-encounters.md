title: "The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Our Encounters"
excerpt: "I participated in a seminar on a new book, Encountering Artificial Intelligence, 1 exploring the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) from within the Catholic intellectual tradition. I was not involved with the book but asked to be a respondent to two of the contributors and offer some reflections on evaluating the impact of AI on our encounters."
