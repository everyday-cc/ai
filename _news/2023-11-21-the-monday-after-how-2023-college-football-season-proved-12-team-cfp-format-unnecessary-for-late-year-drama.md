title: "The Monday After: How 2023 college football season proved 12-team CFP format unnecessary for late-year drama"
excerpt: "Brohm inherited a Louisville team that went 8-5 last year with losses to Syracuse and Boston College. Cardinals fans lined up to drive Scott Satterfield to a conveniently located airport and send him on his merry way up the road to Cincinnati. Meanwhile, the Purdue team Brohm left has as many losses this season as it had wins under Brohm last year."
