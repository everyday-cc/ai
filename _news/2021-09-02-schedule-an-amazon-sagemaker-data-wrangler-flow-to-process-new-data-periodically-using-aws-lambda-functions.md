title: "Schedule an Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler flow to process new data periodically using AWS Lambda functions"
excerpt: "Data scientists can spend up to 80% of their time preparing data for machine learning (ML) projects. This preparation process is largely undifferentiated and tedious work, and can involve multiple programming APIs and custom libraries. Announced at AWS re:Invent 2020, Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler reduces"

  - title: "Fine-tune and host Hugging Face BERT models on Amazon SageMaker"
    excerpt: "The last few years have seen the rise of transformer deep learning architectures to build natural language processing (NLP) model families. The adaptations of the transformer architecture in models such as BERT, RoBERTa, T5, GPT-2, and DistilBERT outperform previous NLP models on a wide range of tasks,"
