  - title: "AI Is Reshaping Chip Design. But Where Will It End?"
    excerpt: "Using AI reduces design costs, improves yields and performance, and shortens time-to-market for better chips. Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems, and many hyperscal chip designers are now adopting generative AI capabilities to facilitate chip design. Think of this as the second generation of AI for EDA. Where might this lead?"
