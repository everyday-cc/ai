title: "Predicting Spike Features of Hodgkin-Huxley-Type Neurons With Simple Artificial Neural Network"
excerpt: "In this study, the feature prediction module (FPM) based on simple artificial neural network (ANN) was proposed to predict spike features including maximum voltage, minimum voltage, and dropping interval. Nine different HH-type models were adopted whose ..."
