title: "Novel device for exploratory imaging enables about 1,000 times more access to brain tissue"
excerpt: "The tool overcomes the drawback of traditional brain probes — the small amount of tissue they can access, which limits their ability to image neurons of interest. The innovation is to insert an imaging probe with side-viewing capabilities into a previously inserted optically matched channel — an ultrathin-wall glass capillary — to convert deep brain imaging into endoscopic imaging."
