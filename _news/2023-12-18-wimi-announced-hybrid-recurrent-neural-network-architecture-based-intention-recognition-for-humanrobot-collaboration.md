title: "WiMi Announced Hybrid Recurrent Neural Network Architecture-Based Intention Recognition for Humanâ€“Robot Collaboration"
excerpt: "Loop layer: The loop layer utilizes RNN to capture the sequence information of the input data. Commonly used RNN units include long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Through recurrent connections, the RNN can model the input sequence and pass the historical information to the subsequent layers."
