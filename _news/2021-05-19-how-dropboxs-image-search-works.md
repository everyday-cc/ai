title: "How Dropbox’s ‘Image Search’ Works?"
excerpt: "However, Dropbox’s new ‘image search’ feature suggests relevant images and calls out the best match, based on a few descriptive words. For instance, if you are looking for photos from a picnic, you can type in the keyword ‘picnic’ or other objects in the image that you can vaguely recall/remember."
