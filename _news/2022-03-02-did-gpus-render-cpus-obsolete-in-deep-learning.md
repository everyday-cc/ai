  - title: "Reinforcement learning: How rewards create intelligent machines"
    excerpt: "The researchers suggested that we could reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) using one single approach: reinforcement learning. They titled their paper on the subject: “Reward is Enough.” The team argued that AGI could emerge through an incentive mechanism known as a reward function."
