title: "Orchestrate Ray-based machine learning workflows using Amazon SageMaker"
excerpt: "Machine learning (ML) is becoming increasingly complex as customers try to solve more and more challenging problems. This complexity often leads to the need for distributed ML, where multiple machines are used to train a single model. Although this enables parallelization of tasks across multiple nodes,"

    excerpt: "Large language model (LLM) agents are programs that extend the capabilities of standalone LLMs with 1) access to external tools (APIs, functions, webhooks, plugins, and so on), and 2) the ability to plan and execute tasks in a self-directed fashion. Often, LLMs need to interact with other software, databases,"
