title: "The world’s coral reefs are bigger than we thought – but it took satellites, snorkels and machine learning to see them"
excerpt: "The world’s coral reefs are close to 25% larger than we thought. By using satellite images, machine learning and on-ground knowledge from a global network of people living and working on coral reefs, we found an extra 64,000 square kilometres of coral reefs – an area the size of Ireland."
