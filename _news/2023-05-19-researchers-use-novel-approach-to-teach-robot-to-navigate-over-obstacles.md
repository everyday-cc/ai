  - title: "Researchers Use Novel Approach to Teach Robot to Navigate Over Obstacles"
    excerpt: "Quadrupedal robots may be able to step directly over obstacles in their paths thanks to the efforts of a trio of Georgia Tech Ph.D. students. When it comes to robotic locomotion and navigation, Naoki Yokoyama says most four-legged robots are trained to regain their footing if an obstacle causes them to stumble."
