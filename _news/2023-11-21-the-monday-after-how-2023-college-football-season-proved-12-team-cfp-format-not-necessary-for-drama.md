title: "The Monday After: How 2023 college football season proved 12-team CFP format not necessary for drama"
excerpt: "The only conference that could shake things up is the Big 12. We don't even know who will play for their conference title yet, but if it somehow ends with Texas not being league champion, the Longhorns would still have an excellent case for an at-large at 10-2 with a 10-point road win over an Alabama team that's also in the playoff."

    excerpt: "Brohm inherited a Louisville team that went 8-5 last year with losses to Syracuse and Boston College. Cardinals fans lined up to drive Scott Satterfield to a conveniently located airport and send him on his merry way up the road to Cincinnati. Meanwhile, the Purdue team Brohm left has as many losses this season as it had wins under Brohm last year."
