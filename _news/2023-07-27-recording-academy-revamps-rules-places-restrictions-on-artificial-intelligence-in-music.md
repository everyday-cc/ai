  - title: "AI Is Rewriting the Rules of $200 Billion Games Industry"
    excerpt: "“AI is the game changer I've been waiting for,” 48-year-old Hanazawa said. By freeing developers from the burden of mass-producing graphics, it promises to revitalize the entire industry. “Publishers will be able to take more risks, creators can become creative again, and users as a result can choose from a much wider variety of games.”"
