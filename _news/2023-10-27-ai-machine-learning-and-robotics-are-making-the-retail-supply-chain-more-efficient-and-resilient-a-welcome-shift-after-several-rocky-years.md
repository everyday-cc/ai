    excerpt: "Since Moscow’s invasion began in 2022, we’ve seen fake videos of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky surrendering to Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin announcing a peace deal with Ukraine, and even video game footage being used to claim that a single Ukrainian fighter pilot was taking down Russian aircraft with deadly precision."
