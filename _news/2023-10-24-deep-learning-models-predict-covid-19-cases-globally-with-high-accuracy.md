title: "Deep-learning models predict COVID-19 cases globally with high accuracy"
excerpt: "Results reveal that the model could accurately predict daily COVID-19 prevalence between 9 January 2021 and 31 January 2021 with a median error of only 35%. Maximum error readings were significantly lower than those produced by the ARIMA model, the current gold standard in pandemic prediction."
