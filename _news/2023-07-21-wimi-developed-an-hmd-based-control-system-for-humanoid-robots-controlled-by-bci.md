title: "WiMi Developed an HMD-based Control System for Humanoid Robots Controlled by BCI"
excerpt: "WiMi's researchers took control of the robot and tested its performance by using this new interaction in an experiment. Testers were asked to navigate the robot to a specific location to perform a task. This test was based on visual SLAM feedback, which provides navigation instructions through images of the environment captured by a camera."
