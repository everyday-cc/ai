title: "No. 10 Dodgers return home to face East"
excerpt: "Fort Dodge football coach Nik Moser isn’t fooled by Waterloo East’s early 0-2 record. Moser’s 10th-ranked (Class 4A) Dodgers have enjoyed a tinge of success in the early stages of the season, but his team is in no position to let its focus or execution slip against an old Big 8 rival on Friday."
