title: "ChatGPT vs Bing Chat vs Google Bard: Which is the best AI chatbot?"
excerpt: "GPT-4 is the largest LLM available for use when compared to all other AI chatbots. GPT-4 has over 100 trillion parameters; GPT-3.5 has 175 billion parameters. More parameters means that, essentially, the model is trained on more data, which makes it more likely to answer questions correctly."
