  - title: "Waymo pushes back its self-driving truck efforts to focus on ride hailing"
    excerpt: "Waymo justified the decision by pointing to \"significant\" growth in demand for its robotaxis in Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco. It also noted rapid upgrades to Driver, the AI system that handles its autonomous cars. There's \"tremendous momentum\" in One, the co-chiefs say, and the new strategy will help make the most of this trend."
