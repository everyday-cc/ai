title: "Voice referendum Yes activists driven by revenge and retribution"
excerpt: "Thomas Mayo said the voice was “a black political force to be reckoned with”. Teela Reid said the voice was “the first step in redistributing power”. The longer version of the Uluru Statement mentions the goals of “self-government”, “self-determination”, “reparations” and “a financial settlement”. Does this sound like a “gracious request”?"
