title: "Queen Elizabeth II: the politics of national mourning left no space for dissenting voices"
excerpt: "After eleven days of national mourning following the death of II, a full day of ceremonies brought the second Elizabethan era to a close. The official nature of this period – during which all political wrangling was cast to one side to allow the country to unite and grieve for the loss of the late monarch – was underlined by the administrative use of capital letters for “ National Mourning ”."
