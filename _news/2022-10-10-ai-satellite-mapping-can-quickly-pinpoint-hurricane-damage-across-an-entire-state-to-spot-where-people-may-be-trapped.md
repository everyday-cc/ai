title: "AI satellite mapping can quickly pinpoint hurricane damage across an entire state to spot where people may be trapped"
excerpt: "Hurricane Ian left an extraordinarily broad path of destruction across much of South Florida. That was evident in reports from the ground, but it also shows up in satellite data. Using a new method, our team of spatial and environmental analysts was able to quickly provide a rare big picture view of damage across the entire state."
