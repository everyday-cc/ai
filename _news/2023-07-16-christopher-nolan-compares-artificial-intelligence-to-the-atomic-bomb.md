excerpt: "After a screening of his new film, Oppenheimer Saturday night, director Christopher Nolan suggested that his period piece couldn't have come at a better time, as we're in an “Oppenheimer moment,” he said. But this time, the dangerous technology isn't being created in a lab in a New Mexico lab; it's coming from Silicon Valley."
