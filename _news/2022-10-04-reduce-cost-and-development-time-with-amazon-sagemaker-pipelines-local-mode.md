title: "Reduce cost and development time with Amazon SageMaker Pipelines local mode"
excerpt: "Creating robust and reusable machine learning (ML) pipelines can be a complex and time-consuming process. Developers usually test their processing and training scripts locally, but the pipelines themselves are typically tested in the cloud. Creating and running a full pipeline during experimentation"
