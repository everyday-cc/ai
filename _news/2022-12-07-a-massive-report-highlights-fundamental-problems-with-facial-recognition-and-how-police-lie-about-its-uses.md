title: "A massive report highlights fundamental problems with facial recognition and how police lie about its uses."
excerpt: "The anecdote opens a landmark report on facial recognition from the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy & Technology, which found that law enforcement agencies are often using the technology as the sole basis for putting people in jail despite claiming they donâ€™t and despite a growing body of evidence that the technology has serious problems with accuracy and bias."
