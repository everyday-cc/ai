excerpt: "Improved ray tracing will be a welcome addition for the PS5 Pro but Sony’s upgraded PS5 could also feature an AI chip inside the console’s APU. Just like AMD does with its mobile Ryzen chips, the chip that will power the PS5 Pro could also feature an XDNA 2 NPU or Neural Processing Unit."
