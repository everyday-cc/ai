title: "Photoshop's New AI Tool Lets You Expand Images With New Scenery"
excerpt: "Generative expand lets you use Photoshop's image-cropping tool to add new imagery beyond the borders of an image's original size. As with generative fill, Photoshop generates imagery based on a text prompt like \"forest\" or, if you don't type anything, just makes its best guess based on what's already in the image."
