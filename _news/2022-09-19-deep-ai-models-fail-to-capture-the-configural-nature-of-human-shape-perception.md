title: "Deep AI models fail to capture the configural nature of human shape perception"
excerpt: "Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) don't see objects the way humans do – using configural shape perception – and that could be dangerous in real-world AI applications, says Professor James Elder,"

    excerpt: "Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) don't see objects the way humans do -- using configural shape perception -- and that could be dangerous in real-world AI applications. The study employed novel visual stimuli called 'Frankensteins' to explore how the human brain and DCNNs process holistic,"
