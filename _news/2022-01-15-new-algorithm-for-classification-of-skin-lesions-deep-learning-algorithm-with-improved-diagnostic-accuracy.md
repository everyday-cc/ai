title: "New algorithm for classification of skin lesions - deep learning algorithm with improved diagnostic accuracy"
excerpt: "Dermatologists typically classify skin lesions based on multiple data sources. Algorithms that fuse the information together can support this classification. An international research team has now developed an algorithm that classifies skin lesions more accurately than previous algorithms by using an improved data fusion process."
