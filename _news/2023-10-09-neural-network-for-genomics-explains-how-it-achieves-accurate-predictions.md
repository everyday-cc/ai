  - title: "Neural Network for Genomics Developed that Explains How It Achieves Accurate Predictions"
    excerpt: "A team of New York University computer scientists has created a neural network that can explain how it reaches its predictions. The work reveals what accounts for the functionality of neural networks—the engines that drive artificial intelligence and machine learning—thereby illuminating a process that has largely been concealed from users."
