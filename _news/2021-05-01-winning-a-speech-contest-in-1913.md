title: "Winning a speech contest in 1913"
excerpt: "The winning UJ team included Edna L’Moore, sister of western author Louis L’Amour. The same night the UJ Oratorical Team, a speech-making team, traveled to Fargo for the State Oratorical Contest. This seems to be a contest among the colleges and universities of North Dakota to see which institution had the best student speakers."
