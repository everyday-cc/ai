title: "Why Darius Rucker Won’t Write Songs With AI: ‘It’s Scary, Man’"
excerpt: "But not Darius Rucker — he says that an AI chatbot is one co-writer he doesn't plan on ever inviting to a writer's room. \"People wanna use it and everything for songwriting — technology's just way in front of me,\" the singer told press on Thursday, June 8, backstage at Nissan Stadium before his surprise CMA Fest performance."
