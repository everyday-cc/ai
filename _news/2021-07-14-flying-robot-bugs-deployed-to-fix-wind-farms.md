title: "Flying robot bugs deployed to fix wind farms"
excerpt: "Six-legged robotic “bugs” could soon be repairing offshore wind farms, putting an end to humans doing risky maintenance and potentially lowering energy bills in the process. Engineers have proven the concept for an autonomous vessel kitted out with technology that can scan blades for defects from a distance."

    excerpt: "One of the UK’s most ambitious robotics projects has proven the concept for robotic teams repairing offshore wind farms. The project paves the way for human-robot teams at wind farms within 10 years and wind farms designed for robotic maintenance by 2050 – a scenario that will be vital to the UK achieving its Net Zero targets."
