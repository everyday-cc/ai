title: "Bioengineers Improve Operation of Brain-Controlled Robotic Arm"
excerpt: "When an individual operates a prosthetic arm, especially a mind-controlled technology, it becomes extremely difficult to have complete motor control to do things like touch or grasp. A team of bioengineers from the University of Pittsburgh Rehab Neural Engineering Labs has detailed in a new Science paper how brain stimulation that evokes tactile sensations can"
