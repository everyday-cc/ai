title: "‘Renewed determination’: Read Jim Chalmers’ federal budget speech in full"
excerpt: "Wages growth for 2023–24 is now forecast to be 4 per cent – up a ¼ of a percentage point from what was expected in October. This combination of lower than expected inflation and higher wages, means that an earlier and stronger return to real wages growth is forecast for 2023–24."
