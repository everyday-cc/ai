title: "Daywatch: Illinois’ fewest COVID cases since March 2020, state Senate passes elected school board for Chicago and facial recognition for fish?"
excerpt: "There was another major COVID-19 update in Chicago yesterday too: the city’s health officials announced that there are no states listed on the travel order. This means that visitors to Chicago will no longer be required to quarantine or obtain a negative test result before arriving — for the first time since last July."
