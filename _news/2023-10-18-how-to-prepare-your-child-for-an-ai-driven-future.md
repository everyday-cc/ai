  - title: "Why Your Strategy For AI Might Be To Not Do AI"
    excerpt: "Choose a problem that actually needs AI. Avoid having a solution (AI) and trying to find a problem to solve. Identify problems or opportunities that your organization has and assess whether AI is the right tool for the job. This way you focus investment and prevent over-engineering costly solutions."
