title: "Artificial Intelligence Makes Its Way Into Songwriting With a Song About Milwaukee"
excerpt: "Blues singer Stephen Hull agreed that the song had a certain spirit to it but “you can tell it was written by someone who doesn't have a background in songwriting, or something.” The musicians did agree that the song may work for commercial jingles, just not one that would evoke emotions."
