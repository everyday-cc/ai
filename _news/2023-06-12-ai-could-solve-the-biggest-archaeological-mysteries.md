excerpt: "So, saddle up and take a tour of how AI is taking on some of the biggest unsolved historical cases, from deciphering scrolls and secret languages to dating mysterious remains. In ‘The Last Crusade’, Indiana Jones reads an incomplete medieval stone tablet in Latin (with a little help from his father’s notebook) to reveal the location of the Holy Grail."
