title: "Why Intel has joined the race for the AI-enabled laptop"
excerpt: "But Intel has been talking up AI-PC and the fact that it’s building AI-dedicated cores into its newest processors for quite some time. Its hardware partners have also dropped AI-PC mentions, and all this suggests that Intel thinks it can still take control of the narrative, or at least some of it."
