title: "Masters champ Scheffler gives US Open some name recognition"
excerpt: "The idea of the U.S. Open being open to all doesn't stop with qualifying for the right to just play the toughest test in golf. Another day brought another surprise to The Country Club when Nick Hardy — technically the last player into the 156-man field — pieced together a 2-under 68 on Friday to share the lead with Masters champion Scottie Scheffler among the early starters."
