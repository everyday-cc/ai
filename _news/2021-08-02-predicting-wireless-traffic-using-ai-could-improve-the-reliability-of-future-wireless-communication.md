title: "Predicting wireless traffic using AI could improve the reliability of future wireless communication"
excerpt: "The prediction of future wireless traffic volumes using artificial intelligence (AI) would allow communication systems to automatically adjust network resources to maximize reliability. KAUST researchers have now developed a more accurate \"dual attention\" prediction scheme that minimizes the volume of prediction data that needs to be transferred across the network."
