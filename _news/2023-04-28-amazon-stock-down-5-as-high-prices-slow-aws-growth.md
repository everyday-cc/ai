title: "Amazon Stock Down 5% As High Prices Slow AWS Growth"
excerpt: "Amazon stock fell after CFO, Brian Olsavsky, told investors that the AWS growth rate in April is tracking five percentage points below its first quarter growth rate. Were that slowdown to continue, AWS could grow at 10.8% in the second quarter â€” well below the 13% Wall Street projects for the second quarter, the Journal wrote."
