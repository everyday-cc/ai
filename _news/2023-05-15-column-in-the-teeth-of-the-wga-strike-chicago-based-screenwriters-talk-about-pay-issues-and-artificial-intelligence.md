title: "Column: In the teeth of the WGA strike, Chicago-based screenwriters talk about pay issues — and artificial intelligence"
excerpt: "The last WGA strike, in late 2007 and early 2008, lasted 100 days and cost the industry an estimated $2 billion. Last month, as the latest strike loomed, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos said in an earnings call: “We really don’t want this to happen.” But, he added, “we do have a pretty robust slate of releases to take us into (the near future).”"
