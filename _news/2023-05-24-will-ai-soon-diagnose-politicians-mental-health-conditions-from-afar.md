title: "Will AI soon diagnose politicians’ mental health conditions from afar?"
excerpt: "Instead, I want to make a strange, speculative prediction: that the need for resolution will soon be behind us. We won’t have to rely on doctors to diagnose public figures. Bots will do that job. One objection to diagnosis based on public behavior is that it lacks the nuance and specificity of face-to-face interviews."
