title: "The Potential of AI and Nanotech in Precision Medicine"
excerpt: "Innovative technologies are bringing new capabilities to health care and precision medicine that once would be considered in the realm of science fiction. In 1966, the science-fiction film Fantastic Voyage told the story of a team of scientists and their submarine vessel who were shrunken to about the size of a microbe and had 60 minutes to find and treat a blood clot after being injected into the bloodstream before they return to their normal size."
