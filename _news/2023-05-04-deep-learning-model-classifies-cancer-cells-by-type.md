title: "Deep Learning Model Classifies Cancer Cells by Type"
excerpt: "The team’s neural network is also simple to use, efficient, and automated. After feeding it an image, the tool converts the data to a probability. A result lower than 0.5 categorizes the cancer as one cell type, while a number higher than 0.5 designates another."

  - title: "Researchers develop a deep learning model to classify cancer cells by type"
    excerpt: "Cancer cells that initiate metastasis, or the spread of the disease from its primary location, are different from cancer cells that stay in the original tumor. Distinguishing metastasis-initiating cell types can determine the severity of cancer and help medical practitioners decide on a course of treatment."
