title: "Does Gemini completely replace Google Assistant?"
excerpt: "If Google is going to replace Assistant with Gemini, we’re in for a very long transition where Assistant on every form factor has to be painstakingly replicated while making sure feature parity is maintained. Even the entirely optional migration on phones is pretty rough, and that doesn’t make for a promising start."
