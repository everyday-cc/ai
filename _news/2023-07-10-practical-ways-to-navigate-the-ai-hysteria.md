title: "Practical Ways to Navigate the AI Hysteria"
excerpt: "AI inputs, outputs, and work must be humanly readable, auditable, and understandable to fix mistakes. AI must not be designed to manipulate people or organizations, have no surveillance, or be used as a strategy for widespread job displacement. AI must protect individual privacy and eliminate bias to create a level playing field."
