title: "Diagnostic accuracy of current machine learning classifiers for age-related macular degeneration: a systematic review and meta-analysis"
excerpt: "The objective of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze the diagnostic accuracy of current machine learning classifiers for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Artificial intelligence diagnostic algorithms can automatically detect and diagnose AMD through training data from large sets of fundus or OCT images."
