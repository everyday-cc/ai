title: "Google Messages could soon let you double tap to react"
excerpt: "As spotted by 9to5Google in an APK teardown, it appears that Google is testing out an option that would allow users to double-tap to react in the Messages app. This is based on code seen in the beta version of the app, but it has not been confirmed by the company, nor has it been officially rolled out on the stable or beta channel."
