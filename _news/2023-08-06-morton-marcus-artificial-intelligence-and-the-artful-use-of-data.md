title: "Morton Marcus: Artificial intelligence and the artful use of data"
excerpt: "“The most obvious way to avoid a crisis in Social Security,” Art said, “is for Congress to raise the cap on the level of earnings being taxed. Right now that cap is $160,200 per year. That means more than 20% of all earnings go untaxed for Social Security, but only about 7% of workers make more than the cap.”"
