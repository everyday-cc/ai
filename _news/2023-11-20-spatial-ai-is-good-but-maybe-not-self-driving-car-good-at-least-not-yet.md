title: "Spatial AI Is Good, But Maybe Not ‘Self-Driving Car Good’ – At Least, Not Yet"
excerpt: "“Elon Musk has predicted his company Tesla would deliver fully autonomous vehicles by the end of 2021, but he made similar predictions in 2020, 2019, and 2017,” Kirkpatrick writes. “Each prediction has fallen flat, largely due to real-world safety concerns, particularly related to how self-driving cars perform in adverse conditions or situations.”"
