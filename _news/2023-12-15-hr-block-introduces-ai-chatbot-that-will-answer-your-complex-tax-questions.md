title: "H&R Block introduces AI chatbot that will answer your complex tax questions"
excerpt: "H&R Block said its goal with this new AI-enabled feature is to to help customers understand how their taxes work, rather than just being told where to put a certain number. The company hopes the advice from AI Tax Assist helps keep customers on the H&R Block site, instead of turning to Google search."
