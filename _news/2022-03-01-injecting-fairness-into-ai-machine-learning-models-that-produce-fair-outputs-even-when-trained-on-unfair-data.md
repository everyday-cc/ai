title: "Injecting Fairness Into AI: Machine-Learning Models That Produce Fair Outputs Even When Trained on Unfair Data"
excerpt: "A new technique boosts modelsâ€™ ability to reduce bias, even if the dataset used to train the model is unbalanced. If a machine-learning model is trained using an unbalanced dataset, such as one that contains far more images of people with lighter skin than people with darker skin,"
