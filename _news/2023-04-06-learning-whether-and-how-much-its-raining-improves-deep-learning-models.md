title: "Learning whether and how much it's raining improves deep-learning models"
excerpt: "Concentrating on one thing at a time might seem like a good strategy when you're trying to learn something. But now, researchers from the Institute of Industrial Science at the University of Tokyo have found that simultaneously learning two tasks helps a deep-learning model perform better on both when retrieving precipitation information from satellite data."
