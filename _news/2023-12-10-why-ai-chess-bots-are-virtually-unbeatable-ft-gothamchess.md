title: "Why AI Chess Bots Are Virtually Unbeatable (ft. GothamChess)"
excerpt: "Most chess openings are subjective for humans. because they get more fun out of it. That's how most players choose their openings. In my game against Stockfish, I played Pawn to D4. and it responded Knight to F6. 'cause we can't access them during tournament games. That would be like cheating on a school test."
