excerpt: "HIFI launched in the US last year with major league supporters including Matt Pincus, who joined HIFI’s board and is an investor via his financial vehicle MUSIC – a joint venture with LionTree. The Music Fund uses Artificial Intelligence to power what it calls a “smart-pricing algorithm” that promises to offer artists up-front cash within 24 hours for a portion of their royalty income for a defined period of time."
