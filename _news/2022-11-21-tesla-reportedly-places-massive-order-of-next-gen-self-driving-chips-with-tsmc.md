excerpt: "Tesla has reportedly placed a massive order of chips for its next-gen Full Self-Driving (FSD) computer with Taiwan’s TSMC. The order is so large that it might make Tesla one of TSMC’s biggest customers. Back in 2016, Tesla started building a team of chip architects led by legendary chip designer Jim Keller to develop its own silicon."
