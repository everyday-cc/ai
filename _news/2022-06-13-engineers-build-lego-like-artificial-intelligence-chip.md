title: "Engineers build LEGO-like artificial intelligence chip"
excerpt: "Imagine a more sustainable future, where cellphones, smartwatches, and other wearable devices don't have to be shelved or discarded for a newer model. Instead, they could be upgraded with the latest sensors and processors that would snap onto a device's internal chip—like LEGO bricks incorporated into an existing build."
