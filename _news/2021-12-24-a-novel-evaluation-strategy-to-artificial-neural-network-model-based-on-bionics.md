title: "A Novel Evaluation Strategy to Artificial Neural Network Model Based on Bionics."
excerpt: "With the continuous deepening of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) research, ANN model structure and function are improving towards diversification and intelligence. However, the model is more evaluated from the pros and cons of the problem-solving results and the lack of evaluation from the biomimetic aspect of imitating neural networks is not inclusive enough."
