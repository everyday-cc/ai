  - title: "Machine Learning Models Can Produce Reliable Results with Limited Training Data"
    excerpt: "The researchers, from the University of Cambridge and Cornell University, found that for partial differential equations—a class of physics equations that describe how things in the natural world evolve in space and time—machine learning models can produce reliable results even when they are provided with limited data."
