title: "Neural network helps design brand new proteins"
excerpt: "To overcome this challenge, Buehler's model turns numbers, descriptions, tasks, and other elements into symbols for his neural networks to use. He first trained his model to predict the sequencing, solubility, and amino acid building blocks of different ..."

  - title: "Neural network helps design brand new proteins"
    excerpt: "A scientist combines attention neural networks with graph neural networks to better understand and design proteins. The approach couples the strengths of geometric deep learning with those of language models to predict existing protein properties and envision new proteins that nature has not yet devised."
