    excerpt: "CNN Business reports that, after speaking with 13 individuals who own a Tesla with Full Self-Driving, 11 of them say that it’s not worth its new asking price. The entire group agreed that the technology has improved over time but some said that they have to pay more attention when FSD is engaged because it can be “unpredictable."
