title: "'Fingerprint' machine learning technique identifies different bacteria in seconds"
excerpt: "Bacterial identification can take hours and often longer -- precious time when diagnosing infections and selecting appropriate treatments. There may be a quicker, more accurate process. By teaching a deep learning algorithm to identify the 'fingerprint' spectra of the molecular components of various bacteria,"
