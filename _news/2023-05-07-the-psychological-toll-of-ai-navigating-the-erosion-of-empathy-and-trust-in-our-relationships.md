excerpt: "Socrates from the 5th Century BC never used the word empathy. He is known for his contributions to ethics and epistemology and said, \"Humans are social animals\" It was the German philosopher Rudolf Lotez in the 9th century who introduced the word Empathy  and later influenced and popularised by many philosophers."
