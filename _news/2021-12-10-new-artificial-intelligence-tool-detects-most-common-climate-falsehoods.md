title: "New artificial intelligence tool detects most common climate falsehoods"
excerpt: "After nearly five years of developing and tweaking, John Cook and his colleagues debuted their project: a machine-learning algorithm that can detect climate misinformation on the web. The algorithm sounds like science fiction: it “reads” a site and flags those with claims perpetrating false and misleading information about climate change science and solutions."
