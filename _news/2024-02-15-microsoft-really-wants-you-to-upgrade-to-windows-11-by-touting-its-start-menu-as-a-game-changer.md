title: "Microsoft really wants you to upgrade to Windows 11 by touting its start menu as a 'game changer'"
excerpt: "If Microsoft wants to convince folks to cough up for a new PC to run Windows 11, it'll have to do better than that. It needs to promote its better gaming features, performance and superior native applications. And, it'll have to convince us why we need AI functionality. That'll be much more of a game changer than any start menu 'upgrade'."
