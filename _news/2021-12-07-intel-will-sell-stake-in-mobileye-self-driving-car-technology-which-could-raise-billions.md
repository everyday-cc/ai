title: "Intel will sell stake in Mobileye self-driving car technology, which could raise billions"
excerpt: "Intel said it will retain a majority stake in Mobileye, an Israeli company Intel acquired for $15.3 billion in 2017. Self-driving cars have emerged much more slowly than Intel and other technology companies expected but Mobileye’s technology remains very highly regarded – The Wall Street Journal wrote Monday that the business could be valued at more than $50 billion."
