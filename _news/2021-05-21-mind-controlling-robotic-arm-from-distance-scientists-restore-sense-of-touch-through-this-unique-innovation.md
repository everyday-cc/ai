title: "Mind-controlling robotic arm from distance? Scientists restore sense of touch through this unique innovation"
excerpt: "Imagine being able to control a robotic arm from a distance, using only your mind. Now imagine being able to feel when its fingers grasp an object, as though it were your own hand. US researchers published a study in the journalÂ Science about the world's first brain-computer interface that allowed a volunteer with paralysis from the chest down to accomplish this very feat."

  - title: "Bioengineers Improve Operation of Brain-Controlled Robotic Arm"
    excerpt: "When an individual operates a prosthetic arm, especially a mind-controlled technology, it becomes extremely difficult to have complete motor control to do things like touch or grasp. A team of bioengineers from the University of Pittsburgh Rehab Neural Engineering Labs has detailed in a new Science paper how brain stimulation that evokes tactile sensations can"
