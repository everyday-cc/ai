title: "Commissioner Mingus Mapps Wants a Robot Answering the Least Dire Calls to the Police"
excerpt: "In August, call takers at Portlandâ€™s emergency dispatch headquarters answered 41% of 911 calls within 20 seconds. The national standard? 95%. City Commissioner Mingus Mapps believes the answer to speeding up response times lies in directing the least urgent calls to a robot like the one who tells you when your Walgreens prescription is ready."
