title: "Researchers develop machine learning models that could improve suicide-risk prediction among children"
excerpt: "A new study finds that the typical ways health systems store and track data on children receiving emergency care miss a sizable portion of those who are having self-injurious thoughts or behaviors. The researchers also found that several machine learning models they designed were significantly better at identifying those children at risk of self-harm."
