title: "Artificial Intelligence Detects New Family of Genes in Gut Bacteria"
excerpt: "Using artificial intelligence, UT Southwestern researchers have discovered a new family of sensing genes in enteric bacteria that are linked by structure and probably function, but not genetic sequence. The findings, published in PNAS, offer a new way of ..."

  - title: "Researchers use AI to detect new family of genes in gut bacteria"
    excerpt: "Using artificial intelligence, researchers have discovered a new family of sensing genes in enteric bacteria that are linked by structure and probably function, but not genetic sequence. The findings offer a new way of identifying the role of genes in unrelated species and could lead to new ways to fight intestinal bacterial infections."
