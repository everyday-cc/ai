title: "Power at the gas pump: Oregon lets drivers fuel their own cars, lifting decades-old self-serve ban"
excerpt: "For the first time in 72 years, Oregon motorists can grab a fuel nozzle and pump gas into their cars without an attendant, since a decades-old ban on self-serve gas stations has been revoked. Gov. Tina Kotek signed a bill on Friday allowing people across the state to choose between having an attendant pump gas or doing it themselves."
