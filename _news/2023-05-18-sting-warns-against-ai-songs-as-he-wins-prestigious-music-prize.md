title: "Sting warns against AI songs as he wins prestigious music prize"
excerpt: "Whether AI-written music can be copyrighted is still under debate. Under English copyright law, for example, works generated by AI, can theoretically be protected. However, the US Copyright Office recently ruled that AI art, including music, can't be copyrighted as it is \"not the product of human authorship\"."
