title: "Scientists invent device that can detect Parkinson’s disease when you’re asleep"
excerpt: "Scientists have developed a device that can detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease — one of the fastest-growing neurological conditions in the world. Parkinson’s disease is notoriously difficult to diagnose as it relies primarily on the appearance of motor symptoms such as tremors,"

  - title: "AI Assessment of Breathing Pattern Aids in Parkinson’s Diagnosis"
    excerpt: "Relying mainly on the advent of motor symptoms like stiffness, slowness, and tremors, Parkinson’s disease is extremely challenging to detect. However, these symptoms usually occur after many years of disease onset."
