  - title: "AI detects Parkinson’s disease by tracking your breathing patterns"
    excerpt: "A compelling new study indicates Parkinson’s disease (PD) could be diagnosed by remotely tracking a person’s breathing patterns. Led by researchers from MIT, the study presents an AI system that uses radio waves to monitor breathing while a person sleeps."

  - title: "AI Assessment of Breathing Pattern Aids in Parkinson’s Diagnosis"
    excerpt: "Relying mainly on the advent of motor symptoms like stiffness, slowness, and tremors, Parkinson’s disease is extremely challenging to detect. However, these symptoms usually occur after many years of disease onset."
