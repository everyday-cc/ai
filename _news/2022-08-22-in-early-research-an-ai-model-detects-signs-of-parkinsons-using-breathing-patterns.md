  - title: "Artificial intelligence model can detect Parkinson's from breathing patterns"
    excerpt: "Parkinson's disease is notoriously difficult to diagnose as it relies primarily on the appearance of motor symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and slowness, but these symptoms often appear several years after the disease onset."
