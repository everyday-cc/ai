title: "Deep learning with light: Components of machine learning model encoded onto light waves"
excerpt: "Ask a smart home device for the weather forecast, and it takes several seconds for the device to respond. One reason this latency occurs is because connected devices don't have enough memory or power to store and run the enormous machine-learning models needed for the device to understand what a user is asking of it."
