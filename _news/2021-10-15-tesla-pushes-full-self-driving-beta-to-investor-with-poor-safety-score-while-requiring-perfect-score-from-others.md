title: "Tesla pushes ‘Full Self-Driving Beta’ to investor with poor ‘safety score’ while requiring perfect score from others"
excerpt: "Tesla has pushed its “Full Self-Driving Beta” to an investor who had a terrible “safety driving score” based on the automaker’s own scoring system. It comes as Tesla says that it is only pushing the software to owners who scored 100 out of 100."
