title: "Windows 11’s speech recognition gets axed in six months, but it’ll work on Windows 10"
excerpt: "Microsoft previously announced the deprecation of Windows Speech Recognition (WSR) and several other apps. In a surprising move, the new Voice Access app will now replace the WSR app on Windows 11 22H2 and newer versions in September 2024, but you can continue using the feature on older versions, including version 21H2 and Windows 10."

  - title: "Windows 11 speech recognition feature gets ditched in September 2024 – but only because there’s something better"
    excerpt: "The date for the replacement of WSR by Voice Access has been announced as September 2024 in a Microsoft support document (as Windows Latest noticed). Note that the change will be ‘starting’ in that month, so will take further time to roll out to all Windows 11 PCs."
