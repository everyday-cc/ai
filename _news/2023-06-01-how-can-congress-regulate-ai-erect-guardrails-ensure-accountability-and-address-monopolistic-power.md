  - title: "Comment: What Congress can do to keep an eye on AI"
    excerpt: "A new federal agency to regulate artificial intellitence (AI) sounds helpful but could become unduly influenced by the tech industry. Instead, Congress can legislate accountability.

    excerpt: "Take Alfie. It’s the prototype of London startup Prosper Robotics and looks like a Minecraft character made real: slightly taller than a grown man, bulky and gliding slowly around on wheels. It is also steered by a team of gamers in the Philippines, who wear virtual reality headsets throughout the day to control its movements."
