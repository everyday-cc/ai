title: "EU needs to show recognition that the Protocol is not working – Aiken"
excerpt: "The speech today from the EU Vice President at Queen’s is little different from the rhetoric that has been used by the EU on the Protocol from the outset. To double down on saying “the protocol is not the problem” while calling for rhetoric to be dialled down is not only contradictory but suggests that Mr Šefčovič is still not listening."
