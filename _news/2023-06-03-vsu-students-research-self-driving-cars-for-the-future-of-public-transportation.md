title: "VSU students research self-driving cars for the future of public transportation"
excerpt: "Currently, the GBI has not made any arrests during its investigation. The sheriff’s office asks that everyone diligently check large bills. According to the incident report from the crash, the tow truck did have emergency lights on. That means it’s considered an emergency vehicle, so the Move Over Law would apply to other drivers on the road."
