title: "Brain scans reveal hidden shape of thinking, predict students’ learning better"
excerpt: "Neuroscientists have documented a link between spatial and verbal reasoning by scanning students’ brains while taking a course that emphasized spatial learning. “For a long time, psychologists and philosophers have debated whether spatial thinking,"
