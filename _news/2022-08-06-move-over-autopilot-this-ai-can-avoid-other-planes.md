title: "Move over, autopilot: This AI can avoid other planes"
excerpt: "The idea is that an AI like this could help fly drones, assist a human pilot, or even someday fly a plane on its own. Right now, in a flight simulator, the AI is able to figure out what another aircraft is doing, or might do, and then figure out how to ..."
