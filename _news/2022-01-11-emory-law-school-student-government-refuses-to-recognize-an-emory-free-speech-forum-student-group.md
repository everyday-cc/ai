title: "Emory Law School Student Government Refuses to Recognize an Emory Free Speech Forum Student Group,"
excerpt: "Yet of course other chartered student groups aren't required to have \"safeguards\" or \"moderator [s] or mediator [s]\" for their events, whatever \"topics of discussion\" those groups offer. It seems clear that the SBA's rationale stems from the student government officials' concern about particular viewpoints that they expect the group to include on those topics;"
