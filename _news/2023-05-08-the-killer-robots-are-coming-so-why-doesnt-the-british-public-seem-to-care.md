title: "The killer robots are coming! So why doesn’t the British public seem to care?"
excerpt: "It is possible of course that the public is just slightly behind the story, and they’ll soon catch up with the likelihood that AI is rather less “handy-internet-shopping-helper”, and rather more “terrifying-future-robot-overlord”, but I’d rather our political masters didn’t take the risk and started actually warning people of the dangers we face."
