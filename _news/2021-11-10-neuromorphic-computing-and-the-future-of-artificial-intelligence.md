title: "Neuromorphic Computing and the Future of Artificial Intelligence"
excerpt: "A specter is haunting Artificial Intelligence (AI)â€”the specter of the environmental costs of Deep Learning (DL). As Neural Networks become ubiquitous in modern AI applications, the gains the industry has seen in applying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to solve ever more complex problems increasingly come at a high price."
