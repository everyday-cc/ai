  - title: "Is This the Most Critical Company in the Artificial Intelligence Supply Chain?"
    excerpt: "At 32 times trailing earnings, ASML is still above its historical levels and comparatively expensive to the market (which trades at around 25 times earnings). However, with AI likely causing a chip arms race and the company's strong execution, it makes sense that ASML is valued at a premium to the broader market."

    excerpt: "As customers introduce AI into their own processes, job roles are expected to change. Engineering, sales and marketing are among the functions most likely to benefit from AI over the next 18 months.
