title: "AI will soon become impossible for humans to comprehend—the story of neural networks tells us why"
excerpt: "In 1956, during a year-long trip to London and in his early 20s, the mathematician and theoretical biologist Jack D. Cowan visited Wilfred Taylor and his strange new \"learning machine\". On his arrival he was baffled by the \"huge bank of apparatus\" that confronted him."

    excerpt: "It may have looked like clunky blocks of circuitry, soldered together by hand in a mass of wires and boxes, but what Cowan was witnessing was an early analogue form of a neural network – a precursor to the most advanced artificial intelligence of today ..."
