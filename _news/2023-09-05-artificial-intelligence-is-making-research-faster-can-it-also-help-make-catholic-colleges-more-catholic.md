title: "Artificial Intelligence Is Making Research Faster; Can It Also Help Make Catholic Colleges More Catholic?"
excerpt: "For Catholic colleges, artificial intelligence (AI) provides both a powerful tool and a reason for caution. Powerful because of its ability to analyze massive amounts of information and produce useful summaries and descriptions in seconds. Caution because of its ability to help students cheat on assignments and otherwise turn off their minds."
