title: "Fans Are Furious At Manga Publisher Bushiroad Over AI Translation Plans"
excerpt: "The overwhelming sentiment is that Bushiroad should be hiring actual translators, rather than what fans believe is the company skimping on costs. It comes at a time where animosity towards AI is already quite high, although itâ€™s worth noting that the stigma surrounding it is much less severe in Japan compared to the West."
