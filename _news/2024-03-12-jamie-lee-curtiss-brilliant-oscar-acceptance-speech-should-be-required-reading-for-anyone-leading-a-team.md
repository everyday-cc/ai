title: "Jamie Lee Curtis's Brilliant Oscar Acceptance Speech Should Be Required Reading for Anyone Leading a Team"
excerpt: "In contrast, a leader driven by ego often creates a culture of fear and competition, where employees may feel undervalued and overlooked. This can stifle creativity, innovation, and the sense of belongingness among team members. Curtis's speech beautifully counters this by showing the power of inclusivity and shared success."
