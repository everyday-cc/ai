title: "Deploy multiple machine learning models for inference on AWS Lambda and Amazon EFS"
excerpt: "You can deploy machine learning (ML) models for real-time inference with large libraries or pre-trained models. Common use cases include sentiment analysis, image classification, and search applications. These ML jobs typically vary in duration and require instant scaling to meet peak demand. You want"
