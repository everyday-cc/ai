title: "Introducing the Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference Benchmarking Toolkit"
excerpt: "Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference is a purpose-built inference option that makes it easy for you to deploy and scale machine learning (ML) models. It provides a pay-per-use model, which is ideal for services where endpoint invocations are infrequent and unpredictable. Unlike a real-time hosting endpoint,"
