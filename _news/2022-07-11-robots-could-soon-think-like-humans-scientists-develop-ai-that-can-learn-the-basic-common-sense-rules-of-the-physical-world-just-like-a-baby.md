  - title: "This Artificial Intelligence System Gains Intuition Like a Human Baby"
    excerpt: "Monisha Ravisetti covers all things science at CNET. On a separate note, she plays a ton of online chess and is a fan of overly complicated sci-fi movies. Scientists taught a deep learning system to learn intuitive physics the same way human babies do."
