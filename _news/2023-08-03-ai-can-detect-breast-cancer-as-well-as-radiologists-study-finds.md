  - title: "AI-supported screenings increase breast cancer detection by 20%, study says"
    excerpt: "The group whose scans were assisted by AI found 20% more cancers than the group without AI assistance. However, this doesn’t mean hospitals will let a computer determine whether a patient has cancer any time soon. The authors of the study say there is still a lot more research to do."

    excerpt: "Previous studies have looked at using AI to diagnose breast cancer in mammograms, but they were retrospective, meaning the screenings had already been examined by radiologists. The study’s co-author said it’s too early to start implementing AI in ..."

    excerpt: "A study has shown that artificial intelligence can be safely used to support mammography to spot breast cancers and may spot more tumours than the current standard approach. The Swedish trial published in The Lancet Oncology found that one expert reader using ScreenPoint's Transpara AI to look at mammograms was at least as good,"
