title: "Supernova festival: How massacre unfolded from verified video and social media"
excerpt: "They had gathered in a remote area of southern Israel for the Supernova festival - an event that had promised dance, music, art and drinks at a secret location. Ticket holders were told, nearer the time, to head to a site north of the Re'im kibbutz, about 6km (3.7 miles) east of Gaza. The party's organisers promised a \"journey of unity and love\"."
