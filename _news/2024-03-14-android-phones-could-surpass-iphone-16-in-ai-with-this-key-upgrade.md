title: "Android phones could surpass iPhone 16 in AI with this key upgrade"
excerpt: "Korean site Ajunews (via Wccftech) reports that the 8 Gen 4 could be the first smartphone chip to use LPDDR6 RAM, an upcoming memory standard. This will supposedly benefit from a higher data bandwidth compared to current LPDDR5, LPDDR5X and LPDDR5T standards, a key factor holding back on-device AI processing right now."
