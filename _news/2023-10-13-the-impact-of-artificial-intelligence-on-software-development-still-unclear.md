  - title: "Will Artificial Intelligence Lead to a New Era of Game Development?"
    excerpt: "AI is also going to affect bots in competitive games. Machine learning can allow AI bots to better mimic human players and perhaps even find new skill ceilings. Generative AI will also change how non-playable characters (NPCs) behave in story games. NPCs can take on personalities and become interactive, instead of just having predetermined lines."
