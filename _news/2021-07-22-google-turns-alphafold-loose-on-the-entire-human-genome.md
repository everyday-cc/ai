title: "Google turns AlphaFold loose on the entire human genome"
excerpt: "Just one week after Google's DeepMind AI group finally described its biology efforts in detail, the company is releasing a paper that describes how it analyzed nearly every protein encoded in the human genome and predicted its likely three-dimensional structure—a structure that can be critical for understanding disease and designing treatments."
