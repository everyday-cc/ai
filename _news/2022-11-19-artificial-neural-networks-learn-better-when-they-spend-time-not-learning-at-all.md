title: "Artificial neural networks learn better when they spend time not learning at all"
excerpt: "Depending on age, humans need 7 to 13 hours of sleep per 24 hours. During this time, a lot happens: Heart rate, breathing and metabolism ebb and flow; hormone levels adjust; the body relaxes. Not so much in the brain."

  - title: "Artificial neural networks learn better when they spend time not learning at all: Research"
    excerpt: "\"In other projects, we use computer models to develop optimal strategies to apply stimulation during sleep, such as auditory tones, that enhance sleep rhythms and improve learning. This may be particularly important when memory is non-optimal, such as when memory declines in aging or in some conditions like Alzheimer's disease.\" (ANI)"
