title: "Student Book Recommendation: \"Futureproof\" and our changing attitudes toward artificial intelligence"
excerpt: "One of the first science fiction writers to take a different approach was Isaac Asimov, who disliked how all the robot stories he read presented artificial intelligences as either identical to humans or destructive monsters. Asimovâ€™s robot stories introduced the idea of robots as being typical machines that could be used for good or ill."
