title: "Why civil liberty groups are fighting for facial recognition ban: ‘It’s intrusive and dangerous’"
excerpt: "And is the omnipresence of LFRT (live facial recognition technology) actually making our lives safer or creating more dangers and division? Those campaigning to ban it argue there is no safe way of using LFRT in public spaces due to the fact it could worsen police treatment of minority communities and totally change the relationship between the individual and the state."
