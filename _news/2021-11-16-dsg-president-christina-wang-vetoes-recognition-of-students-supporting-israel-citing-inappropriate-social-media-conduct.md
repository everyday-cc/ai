excerpt: "Duke Student Government President Christina Wang has vetoed DSGâ€™s recognition of Students Supporting Israel. The decision was based on evidence that SSI \"singled out an individual student on their organization's social media account in a way that was unacceptable for any student group and appeared antithetical to the group's stated mission to be welcoming and inclusive to all Duke students,"
