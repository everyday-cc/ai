title: "Increase ML model performance and reduce training time using Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms with pre-trained models"
excerpt: "Model training forms the core of any machine learning (ML) project, and having a trained ML model is essential to adding intelligence to a modern application. A performant model is the output of a rigorous and diligent data science methodology. Not implementing a proper model training process can lead"
