  - title: "Alphabet creates DeepMind offshoot focused on using AI for drug discovery"
    excerpt: "Alphabet has created a new subsidiary called Isomorphic Labs that will focus on using AI processes to develop new drugs. An offshoot from Deepmind, another AI subsidiary of Alphabet, the idea for Isomorphic Labs came after Deepmind's AI system AlphaFold 2 solved a 50-year old protein folding challenge by predicting the 3D structure of a protein directly from its amino acid sequence to atomic-level accuracy."
