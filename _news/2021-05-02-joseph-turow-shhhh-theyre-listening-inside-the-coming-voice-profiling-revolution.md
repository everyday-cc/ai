title: "Joseph Turow: Shhhh, they're listening – inside the coming voice-profiling revolution"
excerpt: "It soon became clear to me that we’re in the early stages of a voice-profiling revolution that companies see as integral to the future of marketing. Thanks to the public’s embrace of smart speakers, intelligent car displays and voice-responsive phones — along with the rise of voice intelligence in call centers — marketers say they are on the verge of being able to use AI-assisted vocal analysis technology to achieve unprecedented insights into shoppers’ identities and inclinations."
