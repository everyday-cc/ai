title: "Joseph Turow: Shhhh, they're listening – inside the coming voice-profiling revolution"
excerpt: "It soon became clear to me that we’re in the early stages of a voice-profiling revolution that companies see as integral to the future of marketing. Thanks to the public’s embrace of smart speakers, intelligent car displays and voice-responsive phones — along with the rise of voice intelligence in call centers — marketers say they are on the verge of being able to use AI-assisted vocal analysis technology to achieve unprecedented insights into shoppers’ identities and inclinations."

    excerpt: "All are listening and capturing people’s individual voices. They respond to your requests. But the assistants are also tied to advanced machine learning and deep neural network programs that analyze what you say and how you say it Amazon and Google – the leading purveyors of smart speakers outside China – appear to be doing little voice analysis on those devices beyond recognizing and responding to individual owners."
