title: "Google’s Genie game maker is what happens when AI watches 30K hrs of video games"
excerpt: "To establish that model, Genie started with 200,000 hours of public Internet gaming videos, which were filtered down to 30,000 hours of standardized video from \"hundreds of 2D games.\" The individual frames from those videos were then tokenized into a 200-million-parameter model that a machine learning algorithm could easily work with."
