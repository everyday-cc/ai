    excerpt: "Advertisement If there’s one thing that shouldn’t be autonomous in this day and age, it’s weaponized drones. There’s just so much that can go wrong there. Artificial Intelligence works most of the time but it isn’t reliable especially in critical situations like these."

    excerpt: "New Scientist says that there is evidence a weaponized drone went on a rogue mission last year where it hunted a human target without being instructed to do so.
