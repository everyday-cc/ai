title: "Mastercard pilots biometric payments, using facial recognition"
excerpt: "Mastercard has begun to trial a biometric payment system for brick-and-mortar stores, using facial recognition rather than contactless cards, smartphones or memorable PINs. The company said its Biometric Checkout Program would let a shopper scan their face using a retailerâ€™s smartphone app and assign their likeness to a bank card stored on file."
