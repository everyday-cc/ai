title: "Self-driving cars could nearly double road congestion, says report"
excerpt: "LONDON: Motorists could be stuck in congestion nearly twice as bad as current levels if self-driving cars become commonplace, a UK government report warns. The UK's Department for Transport (DfT) traffic projections for England and Wales show delays may rise by up to 85% from 2025 to 2060 in that scenario."

    excerpt: "The focus for the past couple years has been on self-driving car technology. While that’s a trillion-dollar opportunity, it’s unclear when self-driving cars will actually hit the market. I performed deep research into self-driving car tech way back in 2015."
