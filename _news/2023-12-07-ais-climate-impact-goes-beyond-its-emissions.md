title: "AI’s Climate Impact Goes beyond Its Emissions"
excerpt: "“It is important for us to recognize the CO 2 emissions of some of these large AI systems especially,” says Jesse Dodge, a research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle. He adds, however, that “the impact of AI systems in general is going to be from the applications they’re built for, not necessarily the cost of training.”"
