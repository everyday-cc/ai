title: "Elite Polarization in South Korea: Evidence from a Natural Language Processing Model"
excerpt: "This study analyzes political polarization among the South Korean elite by examining 17 yearsâ€™ worth of subcommittee meeting minutes from the South Korean National Assembly's standing committees. Its analysis applies various natural language processing techniques and the bidirectional encoder representations from the transformers model to measure and analyze polarization in the language used during these meetings."
