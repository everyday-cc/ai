  - title: "Researchers identify new medicines using interpretable deep learning predictions"
    excerpt: "An important aspect of drug discovery involves determining how well a drug binds to its target (protein) molecule. Typically, this step involves aligning a 3D structure of a drug and its target protein at various configurations in a process called \"docking."
