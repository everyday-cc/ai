title: "Samsung plans to limit Galaxy AI to 2023 devices and newer, for now"
excerpt: "Samsung says Galaxy AI will be restricted to devices released in 2023 and later, for now. It appears that hardware limitations are not the reason why the software won’t run on devices released before 2023. Samsung avoided answering why the Galaxy S23 FE will get Galaxy AI but not the Galaxy S22 series."
