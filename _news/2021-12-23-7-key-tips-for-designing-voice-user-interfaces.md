    excerpt: "That can mean having conversations with your leaders about your goals and priorities so your energy is going into work that will contribute to your career growth. Setting boundaries around your time is also crucial, Whillans said, as is advocating for yourself at work. \"If you do advocate on behalf of yourself and ask for more time if you need it, it's not negatively perceived,\" she said. \"Managers see that as a signal of confidence, that you're committed, that you want to do a good job. And so you're more likely to be seen as more motivated and more powerful, as opposed to less competent.\" A common reaction when you're starting to feel burned out is to lean into work more, and make yourself busier, David said. One of the first steps you can take when you start to realize you're reaching burnout is to \"start leaning into your humaneness,\" she said. \"That is not about what we do, but it's rather who we are being and being able to be present and connected and creative and spontaneous and joyful,\" she said. 'You're not alone, and it's not your fault' It can also help simply to recognize that burnout \"isn't just an individual problem,\" Whillans said. \"Our organizations and society in general are pushing us to feel burnout and feel like we can't take time off.\" \"So it is worth recognizing that this issue is not just something that is under an individual's control, but is rather determined by an organization's culture, and by society,\" she said. The \"recognition that if you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed, that you're not alone and it's not your fault is an important and helpful way to think about the larger problem.\" David also notes that burnout can be a workplace culture problem. \"We can't keep on perpetuating an impossible expectation that it's fine to put more and more and more and more and more load on people, and that it's up to them to adapt. And if they can't adapt, that it's an individual weakness.\" Workplaces like this have a burnout culture, David said. Signs of this include lack of role clarity, overwhelming workloads, absence of community, absence of purpose, lack of recognition and lack of individual control. \"So as soon as you start to do these things in your organizational culture, you've got a burnout culture,\" she said. If you do look for another job, consider this first If you are working in a burnout culture, decide that you can't have those conversations with your leaders about making the culture better and determine it's time to move onto your next workplace, there are some moves to consider first to ensure you're not going out of the frying pan into the fire. First, give yourself time to start laying the tracks for making a switch. Don't quit out of frustration one day. \"It translates, I believe, into a 10%-15% differential in pay when you are searching for a job without having that leverage,\" White said. Second, get to the root of why you're burned out in the first place, David said. Ask yourself what the emotion is that you're feeling. Are you bored? Exhausted? Feeling a lack of control? Those are signposts of what you value in your work, and can help you ensure your next role will be one that values them as well. Bored? Look for a role that allows for a lot of growth and learning. Emotionally exhausted? Look for a role that is more aligned with your values. Feeling a lack of control? Look for a role where you're not being micromanaged and have more autonomy. \"A really important part of emotional health is trying to understand for yourself what your burnout is signposting to you and what your human needs are within that,\" David said. \"And when you start identifying what those human needs are, you'll then be better positioned to know that the role that you're looking for is matched at some level to actually meeting those needs.\" Third, you can do some research on LinkedIn or Glassdoor to see what current employees are saying about the work culture. Fourth, you can ask direct questions about burnout culture during your interviewing process. You can ask questions like: What gets rewarded at your organization? What do managers care about? What do they value? You can also signal your values in your answers in interviews. If asked how you handle stress, and you say you can take on anything and push through stressful situations to get the work done, you're setting yourself up for burnout, Nesdoly said. But if you say that you have some non-negotiable boundaries and personal priorities, but that you make sure to communicate with your manager when you're stressed, you're positioning yourself as someone who wants to work in a supportive environment, she said. Fifth, David said to reframe how you think about burnout entirely. \"When you are burning out, you are in this messy middle -- and there is real power in acknowledging it,\" David said. Burnout can be a transitional period that allows you to take a beat and reevaluate what you value in your work. \"When you're starting to recognize, to name and label and understand your needs and make small changes, you're starting to create levels of what we call, psychologically, 'self-efficacy,' which is really important for people -- and you can do that even within your current job.\" We sell different types of products and services to both investment professionals and individual investors.
