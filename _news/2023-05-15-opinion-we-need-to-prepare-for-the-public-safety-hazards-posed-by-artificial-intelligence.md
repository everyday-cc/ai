  - title: "To understand AIâ€™s problems look at the shortcuts taken to create it"
    excerpt: "If we want to understand how to handle AI, we can return to a crisis that hit the industry from the late 1980s, when many researchers were still trying to mimic what we thought humans do. For example, they were trying to understand the rules of language or human reasoning, to program them into machines."
