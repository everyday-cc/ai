  - title: "AI and robots used to enable faster detection of UTIs"
    excerpt: "When detected early, UTIs can be treated with antibiotics, but if left undiagnosed they can lead to sepsis, kidney damage and even death. Early signs of a UTI can be difficult to spot because symptoms vary according to age and existing health conditions."
