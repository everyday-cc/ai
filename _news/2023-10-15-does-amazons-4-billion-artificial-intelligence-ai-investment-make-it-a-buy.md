title: "Does Amazon's $4 Billion Artificial Intelligence (AI) Investment Make It a Buy?"
excerpt: "While AWS is my favorite reason to invest in Amazon, it only made up 17% of Amazon's revenue in Q2. But it made up 70% of operating income, which shows how critical AWS is to Amazon's profitability picture. Overall, Amazon is moving from consumer goods to a tech-based business, which can be seen in its gross margin improvement over the past decade."
