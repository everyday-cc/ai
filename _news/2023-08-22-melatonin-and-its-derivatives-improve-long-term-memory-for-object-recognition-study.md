  - title: "Melatonin and its derivatives found to enhance long-term object recognition memory"
    excerpt: "Multiple studies have demonstrated the memory-enhancing effects of melatonin and its derivatives in animal models. It is also known that the formation of both short- and long-term memories require the phosphorylation of certain memory-related proteins."

  - title: "Melatonin improves long-term memory for object recognition: Study"
    excerpt: "Talking about the studys results, Prof. Chiba concluded, Our findings suggest that melatonin is involved in promoting the formation of long-term object recognition memory by modulating the phosphorylation levels of memory-related proteins such as ERK, CaMKIIs, and CREB in both receptor-mediated and nonreceptor-mediated signalling pathways.
