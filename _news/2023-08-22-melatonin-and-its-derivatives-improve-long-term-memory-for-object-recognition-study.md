title: "Melatonin and its derivatives improve long-term memory for object recognition: Study"
excerpt: "Multiple research in animal models have shown that melatonin and its compounds improve memory. It is also known that the phosphorylation of specific memory-related proteins is required for the formation of both short- and long-term memories."

  - title: "Melatonin improves long-term memory for object recognition: Study"
    excerpt: "Talking about the studys results, Prof. Chiba concluded, Our findings suggest that melatonin is involved in promoting the formation of long-term object recognition memory by modulating the phosphorylation levels of memory-related proteins such as ERK, CaMKIIs, and CREB in both receptor-mediated and nonreceptor-mediated signalling pathways.
