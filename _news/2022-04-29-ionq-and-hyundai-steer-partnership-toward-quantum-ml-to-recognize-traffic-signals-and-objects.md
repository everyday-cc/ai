title: "IonQ And Hyundai Steer Partnership Toward Quantum ML To Recognize Traffic Signals And Objects"
excerpt: "“QML doesn't need numerous processing steps for traffic road sign recognition like classical approaches to object detection,” he said. “Quantum recognizes a sign and interprets its meaning in one single step.” IonQ has already completed the ..."
