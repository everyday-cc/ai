title: "Microsoft’s stock rallies to record close as more analysts see AI leadership"
excerpt: "A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Microsoft’s previous closing record price. It has been corrected. Microsoft Corp. shares rallied Thursday for a sixth consecutive day of gains and closed at a record high as investors focused more on the tech giant’s artificial-intelligence roadmap and less on the stalled $69 billion acquisition of videogame publisher Activision Blizzard Inc."
