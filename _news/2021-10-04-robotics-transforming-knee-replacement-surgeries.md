title: "Robotics transforming knee replacement surgeries"
excerpt: "The most advanced innovation is the Navio Surgical System, a robotic platform that does not need any CT scan or MRIs and creates a real-time image of the limb and deformity and the surgeon is able to visualise all around the knee and make a plan on how it is going to be after surgery even before the bone is touched."
