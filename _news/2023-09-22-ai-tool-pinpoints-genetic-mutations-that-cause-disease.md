title: "AI Tool Pinpoints Genetic Mutations That Cause Disease"
excerpt: "Google DeepMind has wielded its revolutionary protein-structure-prediction AI in the hunt for genetic mutations that cause disease. A new tool based on the AlphaFold network can accurately predict which mutations in proteins are likely to cause health conditions — a challenge that limits the use of genomics in healthcare."
