title: "Comparing machine learning algorithms for predicting COVID-19 mortality."
excerpt: "Machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used as a potential solution for predicting mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. So, our study aimed to compare several ML algorithms to predict the COVID-19 mortality using the patient's data at the first time of admission and choose the best performing algorithm as a predictive tool for decision-making."
