title: "Govt ploughs ahead with facial recognition system"
excerpt: "One-to-one facial recognition, on the other hand, is used every day for verifying a person’s identity by matching one headshot of a person against another. Think of going through a passport gate or signing up for an app that needs a photo of your driver’s licence and a selfie."
