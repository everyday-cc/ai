title: "Waveform detection by deep learning reveals multi-area spindles that are selectively modulated by memory load"
excerpt: "A new computational approach for detecting sleep waveforms reveals that the 11â€“15 Hz sleep 'spindle', a neural rhythm implicated in memory consolidation, co-occurs widely across cortex much more often than previously thought."
