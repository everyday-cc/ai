  - title: "We know remarkably little about how AI language models work"
    excerpt: "What stood out to me in Will’s story is that we know remarkably little about how AI language models work and why they generate the things they do.

  - title: "Artificial Language Models Teach Us Nothing About Language"
    excerpt: "As the accuracy of natural language processing (NLP) models increased over the 2010s, there was a clear sacrifice in interpretability. Effectively, the more powerful and accurate language models have become, the less cognitively plausible they seem to be."
