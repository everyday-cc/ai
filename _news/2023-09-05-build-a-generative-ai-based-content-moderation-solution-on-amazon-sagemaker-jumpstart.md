title: "Build a generative AI-based content moderation solution on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart"
excerpt: "In this post, we introduce a novel method to perform content moderation on image data with multi-modal pre-training and a large language model (LLM). With multi-modal pre-training, we can directly query the image content based on a set of questions of interest and the model will be able to answer these"

    excerpt: "In this post, we show how the Carrier and AWS teams applied ML to predict faults across large fleets of equipment using a single model. We first highlight how we use AWS Glue for highly parallel data processing. We then discuss how Amazon SageMaker helps us with feature engineering and building a scalable"

    excerpt: "In this post, we target these situations and solve the problem of risking high costs by deploying large foundation models to Amazon SageMaker asynchronous endpoints from Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. This can help cut costs of the architecture, allowing the endpoint to run only when requests are in the"
