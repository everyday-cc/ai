title: "Researchers now able to predict battery lifetimes with machine learning"
excerpt: "Scientists have used machine learning algorithms to predict how long a lithium-ion battery will last. Imagine a psychic telling your parents, on the day you were born, how long you would live. A similar experience is possible for battery chemists who are using new computational models to calculate battery lifetimes based on as little as a single cycle of experimental data."
