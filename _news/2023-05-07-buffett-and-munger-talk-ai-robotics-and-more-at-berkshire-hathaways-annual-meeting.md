title: "Buffett and Munger Talk AI, Robotics, and More at Berkshire Hathaway's Annual Meeting"
excerpt: "There is no denying that Pandora's box has been opened for AI. A UBS study noted that OpenAI's ChatGPT reached over 100 million monthly active users (MAU) in January 2023 after launching on Nov. 30, 2022, making it the fastest application to cross the 100 million MAU mark. It then passed 1 billion monthly page visits to its website in February."
