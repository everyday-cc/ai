title: "Automatic for the people - how robotics is transforming life sciences research"
excerpt: "But in life sciences, lab hardware tends to be standardized: a test tube, bench, pipette, and other specialist equipment will, broadly, be the same in every lab. This means that repetitive processes can be automated and replicated, opening up a global market â€“ and to solve global problems."
