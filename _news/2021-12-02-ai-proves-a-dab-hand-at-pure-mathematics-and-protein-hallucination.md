title: "AI proves a dab hand at pure mathematics and protein hallucination"
excerpt: "One of the reasons artificial intelligence is such an interesting field is that pretty much no one knows what it might turn out to be good at. Two papers by leading labs published in the journal Nature today show that machine learning can be applied to tasks as technically demanding as protein"
