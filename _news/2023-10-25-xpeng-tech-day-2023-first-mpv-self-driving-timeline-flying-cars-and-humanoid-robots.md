    excerpt: "In addition to the two-in-one model, XPeng has also introduced a rugged Cybertruck-esque EV with 6×6 all-wheel drive that houses a separate eVTOL aircraft in its rear. An extended range hybrid system can even recharge the aircraft while driving, giving owners the ability to cruise to elevation, park, and unload the EV’s “human-piloted air module.”"
