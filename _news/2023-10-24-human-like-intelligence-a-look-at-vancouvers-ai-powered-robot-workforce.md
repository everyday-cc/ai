title: "'Human-like intelligence': A look at Vancouver's AI-powered robot workforce"
excerpt: "A Vancouver company called Sanctuary AI is on a mission to develop the world's-first human-like intelligence in general-purpose robots. Not only are these robots about the size and shape of people, but they also have human-like intelligence. As a result, they have a capacity to respond and adapt to their environments similar to the way humans do."
