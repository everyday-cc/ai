title: "Build conversation flows with multi-valued slots in Amazon Lex"
excerpt: "Multiple pieces of information are often required to complete a task or to process a query. For example, when talking to an insurance agent, a caller might ask, “Can you provide me quotes for home, auto, and boat?” The agent recognizes this as a list of policy types before continuing with the conversation."
