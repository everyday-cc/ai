title: "Ask Not What AI Will Do To Humanity"
excerpt: "On one hand, I’m happy to see this topic generating attention. AI is a powerful force seeping its way into every nook and cranny of our lives — as such, it seems prudent that we discuss it. On the other hand, I fear that sensationalist questions such as this will appear fear-based and naïve, dismissing rather than promoting critical dialogue."
