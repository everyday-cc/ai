title: "Perform batch transforms with Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart Text2Text Generation large language models"
excerpt: "Today we are excited to announce that you can now perform batch transforms with Amazon SageMaker JumpStart large language models (LLMs) for Text2Text Generation. Batch transforms are useful in situations where the responses don’t need to be real time and therefore you can do inference in batch for large"
