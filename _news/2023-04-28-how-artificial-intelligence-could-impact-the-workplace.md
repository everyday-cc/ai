    excerpt: "Schnabel is probably too near the centre of the ECB because her most hawkish speeches have all been recent, so they havenâ€™t yet moved the average. Broadbent probably over-indexes as a dove because he speaks rarely and cagily. The opposite may be true of Pill and his unique presentation style. Etc."
