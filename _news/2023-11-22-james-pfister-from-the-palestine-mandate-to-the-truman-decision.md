title: "James Pfister: From the Palestine mandate to the Truman decision"
excerpt: "Truman, given his intellectual and religious background, believed he had done the right thing. When Rabbi Isaac Halevi Herzog visited Truman, he said: “God put you in your mother’s womb so you would be an instrument to bring the rebirth of Israel after 2,000 years.” Tears were running down Truman’s face. (McCullough)."
