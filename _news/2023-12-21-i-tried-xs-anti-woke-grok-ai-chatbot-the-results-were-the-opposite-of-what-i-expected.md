title: "I tried X's 'anti-woke' Grok AI chatbot. The results were the opposite of what I expected"
excerpt: "On the flip side, I asked Grok which presidents are considered the best. Citing opinions from historians and political scientists, it named Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the top three but also pointed to recent polls suggesting that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were among the best in recent years."
