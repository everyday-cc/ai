title: "NPUs are essential for AI, but what are they, and how do they differ from GPUs?"
excerpt: "All three processors can do some image rendering, but they take on different aspects of this workload. GPUs are the heavy lifters here, specifically designed to render complex imagery for video editing and gaming tasks. However, NPUs are designed to work faster with short and repetitive AI tasks, such as working with AI assistants."
