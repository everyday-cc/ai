title: "AI Funds Don’t Like AI Stocks"
excerpt: "AI models have the ability to learn from past data, but no emotions and so no emotional overreactions. The good news is that they do not get caught up in hype or panic. The bad news is that if everyone else gets caught up in hype or panic, the market will go up or down a lot, and the AI managers will miss it. 1"

  - title: "AI Funds Are Missing Out on the AI Stock Boom"
    excerpt: "AIEQ beat the major indexes for its first few years, but then got clobbered in 2022 by the stock rout triggered by the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest-rate hikes. AIEQ’s total return since inception is now about 44%, compared with 93% for the SPY ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 index, over the same period."
