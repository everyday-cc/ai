title: "TuneÂ ML models for additional objectives like fairness with SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning"
excerpt: "Model tuning is the experimental process of finding the optimal parameters and configurations for a machine learning (ML) model that result in the best possible desired outcome with a validation dataset. Single objective optimization with a performance metric is the most common approach for tuning ML"

    excerpt: "Amazon SageMaker multi-model endpoints (MMEs) provide a scalable and cost-effective way to deploy a large number of machine learning (ML) models. It gives you the ability to deploy multiple ML models in a single serving container behind a single endpoint. From there, SageMaker manages loading and unloading"
