excerpt: "PwC has an ambitious forecast for how much Generative AI will add to global growth. As Atkinson said, “Generative AI will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. This will come from a productivity gain of at least 25% — unlocking capacity to build value. Generative AI will create new business models and make existing models better.”"
