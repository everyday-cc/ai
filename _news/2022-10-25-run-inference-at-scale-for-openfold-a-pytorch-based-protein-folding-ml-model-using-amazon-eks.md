title: "Run inference at scale for OpenFold, a PyTorch-based protein folding ML model, using Amazon EKS"
excerpt: "This post was co-written with Sachin Kadyan, a leading developer of OpenFold. In drug discovery, understanding the 3D structure of proteins is key to assessing the ability of a drug to bind to it, directly impacting its efficacy. Predicting the 3D protein form, however, is very complex, challenging,"
