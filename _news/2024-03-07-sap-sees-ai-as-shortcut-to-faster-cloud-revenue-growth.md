  - title: "Apple AI and why investors should expect revenue growth"
    excerpt: "AI can move the earnings needle. Apple has 2.2B active devices, which I estimate are owned by 1.4B active users. If 20% of Apple’s active base subscribe to an AI product (personalized AI) at $10 a month, that’s $33B a year in 80% margin revenue, which would increase operating income by 16%. ($155B in operating income in CY23)."
