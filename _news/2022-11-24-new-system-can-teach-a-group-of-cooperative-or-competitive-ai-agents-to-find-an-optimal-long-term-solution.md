title: "New system can teach a group of cooperative or competitive AI agents to find an optimal long-term solution"
excerpt: "But since it is impossible to plug infinity into an algorithm, the researchers designed their system so agents focus on a future point where their behavior will converge with that of other agents, known as equilibrium. An equilibrium point determines the long-term performance of agents, and multiple equilibria can exist in a multiagent scenario."
