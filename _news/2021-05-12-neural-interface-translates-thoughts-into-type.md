title: "Neural interface translates thoughts into type"
excerpt: "A neural interface has been developed that could enable people with paralysis to type faster than they could using other technologies, by directly translating attempts at handwriting into text. We can think much faster than we can communicate â€” a fact that many of us feel aware of as we struggle with our smartphone keyboards."
