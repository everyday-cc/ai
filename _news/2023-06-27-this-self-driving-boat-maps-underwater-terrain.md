title: "This self-driving boat maps underwater terrain"
excerpt: "Engineers concoct an easier way for scientists to study underwater topography. Step aside self-driving cars, self-driving boats are here -- and they can do more than take you on a cruise. Researchers at The University of Texas at El Paso have constructed a fully autonomous boat that can carry out bathymetric surveys -- surveys of the depth and terrain of bodies of water like oceans,"
