excerpt: "Lam, who founded Quanta in 1988 when Taiwan was disparagingly known as a “clone kingdom” for IBM PC knockoffs, was worth $9.2 billion on the list yesterday, compared with $5.6 billion on the 2023 Forbes Taiwan Rich List published in April. Lam has topped Zhang Congyuan, who at No. 2 has a fortune worth $7.7 billion."
