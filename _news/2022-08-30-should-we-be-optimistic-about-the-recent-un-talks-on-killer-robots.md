excerpt: "This might sound like science fiction, but autonomous weapons systems, also called killer robots, are being deployed in real time. The Turkish STM Kargu II drone was used in Libya in 2020, and it was â€œprogrammed to attack targets without requiring data connectivity between the operator and the munition."
