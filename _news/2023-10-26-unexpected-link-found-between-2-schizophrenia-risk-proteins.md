title: "Unexpected link found between 2 schizophrenia risk proteins"
excerpt: "Blocking the proteins' attachment in the hippocampus resulted in hyperactivity and lower recognition of a familiar object. Though some behavior changes in these experiments differed from the longer list of changes seen in mice completely lacking one or ..."
