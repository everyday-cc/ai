title: "These robot arms were designed to help humans interact with AI"
excerpt: "Jizai Arms is a system of supernumerary robotic limbs. Up to six of these arms can be worn and controlled by the user. The limbs allow the wearer to attach, detach, replace or edit the arms. This was designed to enable social interaction between wearers to support human beings acting with robots and AIs while maintaining a sense of self-awareness and widening the possibility of human actions."
