title: "Using the brain as a model inspires a more robust AI"
excerpt: "Most artificially intelligent systems are based on neural networks, algorithms inspired by biological neurons found in the brain. These networks can consist of multiple layers, with inputs coming in one side and outputs going out of the other."

  - title: "Brain-Inspired Changes Could Make AI More Resilient"
    excerpt: "AI systems are often built using artificial neural networks (ANN) analogous to those of the brain. Like the brain, ANNs can sometimes get confused, either by accident or by the deliberate actions of a third party."
