  - title: "Zuckerberg says Meta is working on open source “general intelligence” for AI"
    excerpt: "Zuckberg's Instagram announcement makes the potential invention of truly general AI seem like a casual business development—it's nothing to be particularly worried about. In fact, it's apparently so harmless and beneficial that they might even open-source it and share it with everyone (\"responsibly,\" of course)."
