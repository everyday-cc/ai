  - title: "Deep neural network model can accurately predict the brain age of healthy patients"
    excerpt: "A study shows that a deep neural network model can accurately predict the brain age of healthy patients based on electroencephalogram data recorded during an overnight sleep study, and EEG-predicted brain age indices display unique characteristics within populations with different diseases."
