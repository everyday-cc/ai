title: "Researchers create a neural network for genomics -- one that explains how it achieves accurate predictions"
excerpt: "A team of computer scientists has created a neural network that can explain how it reaches its predictions. The work reveals what accounts for the functionality of neural networks--the engines that drive artificial intelligence and machine learning--thereby illuminating a process that has largely been concealed from users."
