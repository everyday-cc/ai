title: "How the creator economy is evolving with AI | Jim Louderback"
excerpt: "The world of creators has always moved fast. YouTubers disrupted traditional media, and now AI VTubers may disrupt established creators. Louderback and I talked about the notion of universal basic income for creators and how it might be the kind of job that can withstand the mass job losses that could come with AI."
