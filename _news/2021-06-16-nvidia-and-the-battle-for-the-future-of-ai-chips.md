    excerpt: "To Nvidia, maps are a critical component for self-driving cars, particularly regarding safety, which will be one of the main priorities to get consumers to adopt the technology. The acquisition of DeepMap adds AV-specific HD maps to Nvidia’s Drive platform — the company’s software-defined end-to-end AV product that includes deep neural network training and validation in the data center for compute in vehicles."
