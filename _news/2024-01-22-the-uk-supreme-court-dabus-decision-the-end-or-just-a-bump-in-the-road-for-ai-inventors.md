title: "The UK Supreme Court DABUS Decision: The End or Just a Bump in the Road for AI Inventors?"
excerpt: "The UK Supreme court recently ruled that a trained neural network could not be listed as the inventor on two patent applications filed by Dr. Stephen Thaler at the UKIPO. The decision has sparked interest in the questions of AI and its ability both to “autonomously” devise inventions and to subsequently own them."
