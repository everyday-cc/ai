title: "Deep learning used by seismologists to improve prediction of earthquakes: Study"
excerpt: "The methods that researchers and governmental organisations employ to predict earthquake aftershocks have mostly stayed unaltered for more than 30 years. The large seismology datasets that are currently accessible are difficult for these older models to handle,"
