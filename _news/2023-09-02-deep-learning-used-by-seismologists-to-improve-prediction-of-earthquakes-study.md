title: "Deep learning used by seismologists to improve prediction of earthquakes: Study"
excerpt: "The methods that researchers and governmental organisations employ to predict earthquake aftershocks have mostly stayed unaltered for more than 30 years. The large seismology datasets that are currently accessible are difficult for these older models to handle,"

    excerpt: "The models flexibility could open up new possibilities for earthquake forecasting. With the ability to adapt to large amounts of new data, models that use deep learning could potentially incorporate information from multiple regions at once to make better forecasts about poorly studied areas."
