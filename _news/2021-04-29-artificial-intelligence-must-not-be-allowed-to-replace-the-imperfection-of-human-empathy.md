title: "Artificial intelligence must not be allowed to replace the imperfection of human empathy"
excerpt: "Instead of a human ruling “master race”, we could end up with a machine one. If this seems extreme, consider the anti-human perfectionism that is already central to the labour market. Here, AI technology is the next step in the premise of maximum productivity that replaced individual craftmanship with the factory production line."
