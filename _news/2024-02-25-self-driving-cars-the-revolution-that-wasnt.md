title: "Self-driving cars: the revolution that wasnâ€™t?"
excerpt: "Yet for all the grand promises made by the likes of Tesla's Elon Musk, who in 2016 claimed that autonomous driving was \"basically a solved problem\", self-driving cars and lorries are not yet a common sight on our roads; and as yet, no self-driving system has achieved the longed-for status of \"full automation\"."
