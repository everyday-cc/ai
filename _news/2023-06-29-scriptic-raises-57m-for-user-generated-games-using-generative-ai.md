  - title: "The huge power and potential danger of AI-generated code"
    excerpt: "Late last year, a team at Stanford University posted a research paper that looked at how using a code-generating AI assistant they built affects the quality of code that people produce. The researchers found that programmers getting AI suggestions tended to include more bugs in their final code—yet those with access to the tool tended to believe that their code was more secure."

    excerpt: "China is currently home to some of the most advanced AI regulations in the world. Its party-state government, free from the burden of compromise, can swiftly regulate AI as it sees fit. Beijing has in recent months and years crafted regulations that both (partially) protect citizens from tech companies’ greediest impulses and uphold the paternalistic impulse to preserve state power over individual expression and corporate interest."
