title: "Poised to profit from emerging world of AI"
excerpt: "Since only a portion of a company’s shares are typically sold via an IPO, the rest remain in the hands of insiders or private investors. When those folks cash in their shares – with the proceeds going to the sellers, not the company – it’s generally referred to as a secondary offering."
