  - title: "AI autopilot could let autonomous aircraft fly in busy airspaces"
    excerpt: "While pilots commonly use an autopilot when cruising at high altitudes, they typically switch to manual control when entering crowded lower airspaces. However, what if the plane has no pilot? Well, a new AI autopilot system for busy airspaces may be the answer."
