title: "Create Amazon SageMaker models using the PyTorch Model Zoo"
excerpt: "Deploying high-quality, trained machine learning (ML) models to perform either batch or real-time inference is a critical piece of bringing value to customers. However, the ML experimentation process can be tedious—there are a lot of approaches requiring a significant amount of time to implement. That’s"

    excerpt: "Foundation models are large deep learning models trained on a vast quantity of data at scale. They can be further fine-tuned to perform a variety of downstream tasks and form the core backbone of enabling several AI applications. The most prominent category is large-language models (LLM), including&nbsp;auto-regressive"
