    excerpt: "The social media giant that now goes by Meta has been accused of lying, and continuing to target advertising using their personal data, and prioritising profits over the wellbeing of children. This appears to contradict the company’s announcement that it would limit how advertisers reach kids in an apparent bid to be a better corporate citizen."
