title: "Google and Seagate use AI to predict hard drive failures"
excerpt: "The team tested two different AI models to predict which hard drives would fail, and found that an automated machine learning (AutoML) model worked better than a custom system, giving 98 percent precision - while also enabling Google to find new rules ..."
