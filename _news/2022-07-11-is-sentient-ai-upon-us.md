title: "Is Sentient AI Upon Us?"
excerpt: "Many people would say animals are sentient because they exhibit emotions like joy, sadness, fear and love. We also know that some animals have more complex emotions than others; animals such as elephants are known to mourn their dead relatives in ways we find familiar enough to call grieving “mourning” ourselves."

  - title: "From ‘Sentient’ to ‘Cult’ AI and Information Anesthesia"
    excerpt: "Who am I to tell God where he can and can’t put souls?” From Joseph Weizenbaum’s ‘Eliza Effect’ to Lemoine’s ‘Sentient’ AI, there is an interesting track record behind such events! So while one can have sympathy with Google engineer’s claims on ‘Sentient AI’ (after all Bhartiya culture sees life and soul in every particle around) but the question still is what’s the mystical formula behind this shift in Google’s hiring patterns?"
