title: "Comment: Robots are coming, but with humans at the controls"
excerpt: "Take Alfie. Itâ€™s the prototype of London startup Prosper Robotics and looks like a Minecraft character made real: slightly taller than a grown man, bulky and gliding slowly around on wheels. It is also steered by a team of gamers in the Philippines, who wear virtual reality headsets throughout the day to control its movements."
