title: "Fintech founder says bottom line remains top priority for SMBs"
excerpt: "Mark Hartley, founder and CEO of Bankifi, pointed out that while these subjects may be important to megabanks and their multinational customers, they’re not as important to his smaller financial institution customers and their small to medium-sized business  (SMB) customers in turn. What this group cares about most, he said, is “getting paid.”"
