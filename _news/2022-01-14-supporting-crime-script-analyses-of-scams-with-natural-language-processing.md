title: "Supporting Crime Script Analyses of Scams with Natural Language Processing"
excerpt: "Consequently, there is a strong rationale to enhance our understanding of scams in order to devise ways in which they can be disrupted. Crime scripting is an analytical approach which seeks to characterise the processes which underpin crime events in sufficient detail to aid in the identification of potential points of intervention where crimes might be prevented."
