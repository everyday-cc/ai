title: "DeepMind Proposes Symmetry-Based Representations as a Fundamental Principle for Learning Good Representations in General Intelligence"
excerpt: "The complex behaviours of humans and other animals are products of a biological intelligence informed largely by the learned “good representations” of sensory inputs, which serve as a fundamental computational step for enabling data-efficient,"
