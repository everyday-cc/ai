  - title: "Machine-learning method used for self-driving cars could improve lives of type-1 diabetes patients"
    excerpt: "Type 1 diabetes is one of the most prevalent auto-immune conditions in the UK and is characterised by an insufficiency of the hormone insulin, which is responsible for blood glucose regulation. Many factors affect a person’s blood glucose and therefore it can be a challenging and burdensome task to select the correct insulin dose for a given scenario."
