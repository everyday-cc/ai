    excerpt: "Researchers have proposed a novel AI system inspired by the neuromodulation of the brain, referred to as a \"stashing system,\" that requires less energy consumption. The research group led by Professor Kyung Min Kim from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering has developed a technology that can efficiently handle mathematical operations for artificial intelligence by imitating the continuous changes in the topology of the neural network according to the situation."
