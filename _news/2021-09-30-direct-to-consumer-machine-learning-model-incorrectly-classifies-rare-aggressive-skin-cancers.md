title: "Direct-to-consumer machine learning model incorrectly classifies rare, aggressive skin cancers"
excerpt: "A new study has found that a direct-to-consumer machine learning model for detecting skin cancers incorrectly classified rare and aggressive cancers as low-risk. The breakthrough findings presented at today's 30th EADV Congress suggest that making apps based on such models available directly to the public without transparency on performance metrics for rare but potentially life-threatening skin cancers is ethically questionable."
