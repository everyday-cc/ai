title: "Elon Musk’s new AI model doesn’t shy from questions about cocaine and orgies"
excerpt: "Elon Musk announced xAI's launch of an early beta version of \"Grok,\" an AI language model similar to ChatGPT that is designed to respond to user queries with a mix of information and humor. Grok reportedly integrates real-time data access from X (formerly Twitter)—and is apparently willing to tackle inquiries that might be declined by other AI systems due to content filters and conditioning."
