  - title: "Systematic misestimation of machine learning performance in neuroimaging studies of depression"
    excerpt: "We currently observe a disconcerting phenomenon in machine learning studies in psychiatry: While we would expect larger samples to yield better results due to the availability of more data, larger machine learning studies consistently show much weaker performance than the numerous small-scale studies."
