title: "Snapchat’s AI chatbot posts mysterious video and goes silent, spooking users"
excerpt: "It's not Halloween yet, but some users of Snapchat feel like it is. On Tuesday evening, Snapchat's My AI chatbot posted a mysterious one-second video of what looks like a wall and a ceiling, despite never having added a video to its messages before. When users asked the chatbot about it, the machine stayed eerily silent."
