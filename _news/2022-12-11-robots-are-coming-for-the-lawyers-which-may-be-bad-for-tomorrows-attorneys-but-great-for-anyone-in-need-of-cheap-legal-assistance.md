title: "Robots are coming for the lawyers –which may be bad for tomorrow's attorneys but great for anyone in need of cheap legal assistance"
excerpt: "While technology has been nibbling around the edges of the legal profession for some time, it’s hard to imagine those complex tasks being done by a robot. And it is those complicated, personalized tasks that have led technologists to include lawyers in a broader category of jobs that are considered pretty safe from a future of advanced robotics and artificial intelligence."
