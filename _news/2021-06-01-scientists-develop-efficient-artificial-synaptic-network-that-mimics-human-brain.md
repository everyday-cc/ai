  - title: "Spine dynamics in the brain, mental disorders and artificial neural networks"
    excerpt: "Dendritic spines can be considered to embody algorithms that underlie various brain functions. Here, Kasai et al. review spine dynamics and their roles in various brain functions, compare these dynamics with parallels in machine learning and describe how disrupted dynamics may contribute to mental disorders."
