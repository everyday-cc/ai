    excerpt: "New Scientist says that there is evidence a weaponized drone went on a rogue mission last year where it hunted a human target without being instructed to do so. The publication cites a UN report and says the details suggest a Kargu-2 quadcopter was being used in fully autonomous mode during a conflict in Libya in March of last year when the device pursued a soldier that was trying to retreat."
