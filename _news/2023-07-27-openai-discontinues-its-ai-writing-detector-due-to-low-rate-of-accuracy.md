title: "OpenAI discontinues its AI writing detector due to “low rate of accuracy”"
excerpt: "As of July 20, 2023, the AI classifier is no longer available due to its low rate of accuracy. We are working to incorporate feedback and are currently researching more effective provenance techniques for text, and have made a commitment to develop and deploy mechanisms that enable users to understand if audio or visual content is AI-generated."

  - title: "OpenAI’s ChatGPT is too good for its own AI to detect"
    excerpt: "When OpenAI launched Classifier in January, it was supposed to have been smart enough to detect when a user (say, a student) used ChatGPT or another AI program to author a work. OpenAI pitched Classifier as a way for a teacher to identify if an essay, for example, had been authored by AI instead of as an original work."
