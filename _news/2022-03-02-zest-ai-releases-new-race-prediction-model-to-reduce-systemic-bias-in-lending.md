  - title: "Injecting fairness into machine-learning models"
    excerpt: "If a machine-learning model is trained using an unbalanced dataset, such as one that contains far more images of people with lighter skin than people with darker skin, there is serious risk the model's predictions will be unfair when it is deployed in the real world."

  - title: "Reinforcement learning: How rewards create intelligent machines"
    excerpt: "The researchers suggested that we could reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) using one single approach: reinforcement learning. They titled their paper on the subject: “Reward is Enough.” The team argued that AGI could emerge through an incentive mechanism known as a reward function."
