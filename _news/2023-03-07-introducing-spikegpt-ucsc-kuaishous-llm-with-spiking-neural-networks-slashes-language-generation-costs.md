title: "Introducing SpikeGPT: UCSC & Kuaishou’s LLM With Spiking Neural Networks Slashes Language Generation Costs"
excerpt: "While the power and performance of today’s large language models (LLMs) are beyond anything previously seen from AI, so too are their massive computational requirements. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) — which only transmit relevant information when a neuron’s threshold is met — have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks."
