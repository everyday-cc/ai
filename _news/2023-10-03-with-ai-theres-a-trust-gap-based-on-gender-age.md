title: "With AI, thereâ€™s a trust gap based on gender, age"
excerpt: "Perhaps most striking in the results was the difference in trust in AI depending on the gender of the respondents and when they were born. While 51% of men, 57% of Gen Z, and 62% of millennials indicated they're more excited than concerned about AI, only 40% of women, 42% of Gen X, and 30% of Boomers felt the same."
