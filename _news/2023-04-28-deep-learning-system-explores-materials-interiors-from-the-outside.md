title: "Deep-learning system explores materials' interiors from the outside"
excerpt: "Maybe you can't tell a book from its cover, but according to researchers at MIT you may now be able to do the equivalent for materials of all sorts, from an airplane part to a medical implant. Their new approach allows engineers to figure out what's going on inside simply by observing properties of the material's surface."
