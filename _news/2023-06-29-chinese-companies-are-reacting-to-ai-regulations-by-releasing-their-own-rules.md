title: "Chinese Companies Are Reacting To AI Regulations By Releasing Their Own Rules"
excerpt: "China is currently home to some of the most advanced AI regulations in the world. Its party-state government, free from the burden of compromise, can swiftly regulate AI as it sees fit. Beijing has in recent months and years crafted regulations that both (partially) protect citizens from tech companies’ greediest impulses and uphold the paternalistic impulse to preserve state power over individual expression and corporate interest."
