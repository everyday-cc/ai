title: "OpenAI, Google will watermark AI-generated content to hinder deepfakes, misinfo"
excerpt: "Seven companies—including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, Anthropic, and Inflection— have committed to developing tech to clearly watermark AI-generated content. That will help make it safer to share AI-generated text, video, audio, and images without misleading others about the authenticity of that content, the Biden administration hopes."
