  - title: "US facial recognition app that sold billions of photos of British citizens won’t face punishment"
    excerpt: "A company that sold a facial recognition database featuring information on British citizens has escaped being fined because of a loophole in UK data protection law. Judges have ruled that Clearview AI broke no law when it sold its database to police forces because the buyers were non-UK and therefore outside of jurisdiction."
