title: "Google's AI Has Predicted the 3D Structure of the 'Entire Protein Universe'"
excerpt: "After 22 years of grueling experimentation, John Kendrew of Cambridge University finally uncovered the 3D structure of a protein. It was a twisted blueprint of myoglobin, the stringy chain of 154 amino acids that helps infuse our muscles with oxygen."
