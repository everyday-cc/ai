title: "Tesla reportedly claims its failure to deliver self-driving cars isn't fraud"
excerpt: "Tesla has come under fire once again for its controversially named Full Self-Driving driver-assist feature. Despite what the name alludes to, FSD doesn't enable a car to drive on its own. The feature can handle certain situations but requires a driver to monitor things at all times and to always be ready to correct mistakes."
