title: "Advanced DFT And Silicon Bring-Up For AI Chips"
excerpt: "AI chips can also use hierarchical DFT during failure diagnosis after the IC is manufactured. It allows for core-level diagnosis, which significantly accelerates the process of diagnosis and failure analysis. This hierarchical diagnosis methodology aligns perfectly with the AI chip architectures, which contain repeated identical processing cores."
