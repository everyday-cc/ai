title: "We need to focus more on the social effects of AI, says Nicholas Christakis"
excerpt: "F EW PEOPLE would tolerate a virtual assistant if they had to plead obsequiously each time, “Excuse me, Alexa, if it’s not too much trouble, could you kindly tell me what the weather will be today.” Instead, these devices are designed to answer brusque commands: “Alexa: weather!” And we expect them to obediently respond."
