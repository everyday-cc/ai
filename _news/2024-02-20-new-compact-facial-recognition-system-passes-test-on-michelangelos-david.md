title: "New compact facial-recognition system passes test on Michelangelo’s David"
excerpt: "Scientists have now developed a new facial recognition system that employs flatter, simpler optics that also requires less energy, according to a recent paper published in the journal Nano Letters. The team tested their prototype system with a 3D replica of Michelangelo's famous David sculpture,"

  - title: "Ultrathin, energy-efficient facial recognition can identify Michelangelo’s David"
    excerpt: "Packing in all those optical components like lasers makes commercial dot projectors rather bulky, so it can be harder to integrate for some applications such as robotics and augmented reality, as well as the next generation of facial recognition technology."
