    excerpt: "Bias – unconscious or otherwise – has always had a tendency to seep into advertisements, exerting a subtle pressure on who gets to see an ad and who doesn’t. New research from IBM Watson Advertising and The Ad Council provides a glimpse into the potential role that artificial intelligence (AI) could play in helping brands to reduce bias in their ads."
