title: "Predict types of machine failures with no-code machine learning using Amazon SageMaker Canvas"
excerpt: "Predicting common machine failure types is critical in manufacturing industries. Given a set of characteristics of a product that is tied to a given type of failure, you can develop a model that can predict the failure type when you feed those attributes to a machine learning (ML) model. ML can help"
