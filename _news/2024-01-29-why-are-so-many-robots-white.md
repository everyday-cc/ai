  - title: "Academic demands diversity because there are too many white robots"
    excerpt: "Paterson referred to a book on human machine interaction by anthropologist Lucy Suchman which gives a “cultural imaginary” (what is shared in pop culture, texts and images) of what robots are supposed to look like. He explained that the cultural imaginary can be linked to how computer science and engineering teams view robot bodies."
