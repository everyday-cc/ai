title: "Advocates for People with Disabilities Want Expansion of Autonomous (Self Driving) Taxi Services"
excerpt: "San Francisco’s LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired, along with other community organizations, are urging state regulators to approve Waymo’s permit for its 24/7 self-driving car service. These organizations argue that autonomous vehicles are safer and provide more accessibility and independence for people with disabilities than traditional ride-hailing services."
