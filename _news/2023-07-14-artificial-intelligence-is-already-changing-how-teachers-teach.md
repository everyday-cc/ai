title: "Artificial intelligence is already changing how teachers teach"
excerpt: "Mike Harris knew it could take a full day to design a new class he was teaching at a Kansas high school. But before he started last winter, he turned to artificial intelligence, curious about how it might help. He asked ChatGPT to outline a 16-week drama class at a large urban school, using his stateâ€™s standards."
