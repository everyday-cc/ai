title: "Study shows AI deep learning models can detect race in medical imaging"
excerpt: "A recent study found that AI deep learning models can be trained to identify race in these same medical images. Something radiologists could only determine with 50 percent accuracy. “The AI system, most of our models, were in the 95 to 99%,” Dr. Judy ..."

  - title: "How amalgamated learning could scale medical AI"
    excerpt: "A promising new AI and machine learning technique called amalgamated learning might help overcome these silos to find new cures for diseases, prevent fraud and improve industrial equipment. It may also provide a way to construct digital twins from inconsistent forms of data."
