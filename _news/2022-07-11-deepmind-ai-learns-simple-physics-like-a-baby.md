  - title: "This Artificial Intelligence System Gains Intuition Like a Human Baby"
    excerpt: "Monisha Ravisetti covers all things science at CNET. On a separate note, she plays a ton of online chess and is a fan of overly complicated sci-fi movies. Scientists taught a deep learning system to learn intuitive physics the same way human babies do."

    excerpt: "Now this blurs the line between artificial intelligence and human behaviour as we know it. If an AI can be embedded with ‘gut feelings’ maybe an AI can become sentient enough to guy you too! The worst case scenarios should always be scrutinised before glorifying any research."
