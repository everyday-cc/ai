  - title: "Researchers now able to predict battery lifetimes with machine learning"
    excerpt: "Imagine a psychic telling your parents, on the day you were born, how long you would live. A similar experience is possible for battery chemists who are using new computational models to calculate battery lifetimes based on as little as a single cycle of experimental data."
