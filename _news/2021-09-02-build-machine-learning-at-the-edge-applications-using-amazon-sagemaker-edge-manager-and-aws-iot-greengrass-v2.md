title: "Build machine learning at the edge applications using Amazon SageMaker Edge Manager and AWS IoT Greengrass V2"
excerpt: "Running machine learning (ML) models at the edge can be a powerful enhancement for Internet of Things (IoT) solutions that must perform inference without a constant connection back to the cloud. Although there are numerous ways to train ML models for countless applications, effectively optimizing and"

    excerpt: "Data scientists can spend up to 80% of their time preparing data for machine learning (ML) projects. This preparation process is largely undifferentiated and tedious work, and can involve multiple programming APIs and custom libraries. Announced at AWS re:Invent 2020, Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler reduces"
