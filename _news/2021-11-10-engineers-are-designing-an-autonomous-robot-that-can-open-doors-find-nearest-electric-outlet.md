title: "Engineers are designing an autonomous robot that can open doors, find nearest electric outlet"
excerpt: "\"Robots can do many things, but if you want one to open a door by itself and go through the doorway, that's a tremendous challenge,\" Ma said. Students in UC's Intelligent Robotics and Autonomous Systems Laboratory have solved this complex problem in three-dimensional digital simulations."
