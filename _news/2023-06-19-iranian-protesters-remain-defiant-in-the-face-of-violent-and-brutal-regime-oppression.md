title: "Iranian protesters remain defiant in the face of violent and brutal regime oppression"
excerpt: "Social movements often use symbols to maintain their existence and relevance, particularly in oppressive political contexts. In Iran, removing headscarves has become one of the most important acts of resistance against a regime that still maintains versions of “morality policing” to confront women who do not wear a “proper” hijab."
