title: "What is the Difference between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning"
excerpt: "AI means getting a computer to mimic human behavior in some way. Machine learning is a subset of AI, and it consists of the techniques that enable computers to figure things out from the data and deliver AI applications. Deep learning, meanwhile, is a subset of machine learning that enables computers to solve more complex problems."
