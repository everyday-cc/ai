excerpt: "DSSTNE (pronounced \"Destiny\") is an open source software library for training and deploying recommendation models with sparse inputs, fully connected hidden layers, and sparse outputs. Models with weight matrices that are too large for a single GPU can still be trained on a single host. DSSTNE has been used at Amazon to generate personalized product recommendations for our customers at Amazon's scale. It is designed for production deployment of real-world applications which need to emphasize speed and scale over experimental flexibility."
