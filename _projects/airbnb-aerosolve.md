name: "Aerosolve"
excerpt: "A machine learning library designed from the ground up to be human friendly. This library is meant to be used with sparse, interpretable features such as those that commonly occur in search (search keywords, filters) or pricing (number of rooms, location, price). It is not as interpretable with problems with very dense non-human interpretable features such as raw pixels or audio samples."
